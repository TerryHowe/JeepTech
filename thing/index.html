If you've found this article, you have probably heard the expression,
"It's a Jeep thing, you wouldn't understand".  There is truth to
it, but it is not necessary to completely disassemble and reassemble
your Jeep to become "one" with it and acheive a true understanding.
You can save a lot of time and busted knuckles by reading about Jeeps.
To hasten your trip on the path of complete understanding, we at
Jeeptech have begun to compile Jeep querks and tricks that
will save you hours of frustration.  Even the seasoned Jeeper will
finding interesting tidbits here.

<p>
<strong><font size=5>4.0L Cranks, but Doesn't Fire</font><br></strong>
Sometimes the 4.0L engine will crank fine, but it will not
fire.  I'm not sure what the real problem is, but the engine seems
to have no spark and it acts as if it is flooded.  It is counter
intuitive for a fuel injected engine, but what solves the problem
is holding the accelerator to the floor and cranking.  I've had
this problem half a dozen times, and holding the accelerator to the
floor always resolves the problem.  I assume the computer goes into
a different mode when the accelerator is held to the floor.
</p>

<p>
<strong><font size=5>Stiff Visors</font><br></strong>
Ever get caught in the rain with the top down?  Of course you have.
YJ and CJ visors tend to get real stiff when they have been wet.
Spraying the hinge with WD-40 will loosen them up.
</p>

<p>
<strong><font size=5>CJ 258 Oil Pressure</font><br></strong>
The specification for oil pressure in the CJ 258 is around
13 lbs at idle and 40 lbs warmed up at 3,000 RPM.  Does your
gauge ever show this?  Of course not and most like it is not
because the gauge is broken or the engine oil pressure is
low, it is because the oil pressure sending unit is notoriously
inaccurate.  If you replace the sending unit, it might be
accurate for a while, but soon it will be as accurate as the
old one.  The best bet is to purchase a good mechanical gauge.
The other option is to get used to the relative readings the
OEM gauge produces and use the "audible" gauge.  The audible
gauge is the least safe, but most accurate.  When you hear
lifter noise, add oil.
</p>

<p>
<strong><font size=5>Bright lights, No Lights!</font><br></strong>
If you have a CJ wih the bright lights switch on the floor,
you have probably hit the bright light switch on a moonless night
just before a sharp curve, and suddenly had no lights whatsoever.
The floor switch tends to get wet and dirty and malfunction.  It
is best periodically clean it and lube it with some penetrating
oil.
</p>

<p>
<strong><font size=5>Hard Shifting 5-Speed</font><br></strong>
The AX-15 5 speed manual used in Wranglers, Cherokees, and
a few Grand Cherokees has a reputation for hard shift particularly
in second gear.  The problem is weak synchronizers.  There are
a couple things you can do to minimize the problem.
<ul>
<li>
Don't force it if it doesn't want to shift.  Forcing it will
damage the weakened synchro.</li>
<li>
This transmission shifts better with synthetic gear lube
than it does with dino juice.</li>
<li>
Normally, the problem only arises on a cold day when the transmission
is not warmed up.  Drive a half a mile in first gear to get the
transmission juices flowing.
</li><li>
Learn to double clutch.  When you are ready to shift into second:
<ol type=1>
<li>
press the clutch pedal in</li>
<li>
shift to neutral</li>
<li>
let the engine RPM drop to about 1,000</li>
<li>
let up the clutch pedal</li>
<li>
press the clutch pedal in</li>
<li>
Shift into second</li>
</ol>
The idea with double clutching is you match the RPM you need to
be in second gear when you let out the clutch.  The synchros normally
do this job for you.
</li>
<li>
Try adding shift modifiers to the gear lube.</li>
<li>
Make sure you have enough fluid in your clutch master cylinder</li>
<li>
When all else fails, get the transmission rebuilt</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong><font size=5>258 (4.2L) Idle Problem</font><br></strong>
Idle problems are common for Jeeps with the 258 (4.2L) engine
and the 2bbl Carter BBD carburetor.  The engine is great, the
carb is not.   The problem seems to happen more frequently with
the computer controlled Carter BBD, particularly if you four wheel.
<A HREF="/engine/carter.html">
Fixing the problem</A> is easy and cost nothing but a few minutes and
some carb cleaner.
</p>

<p>
<strong><font size=5>YJ Vacuum axle disconnect</font><br></strong>
The Wrangler YJ has a slightly troublesome four wheel drive system.
The transfer case is a good one, but the vacuum motor that engages
the front axle is prone to failure.  The new Wrangler TJ has done
away with the vacuum motor, so it does not suffer these problems.</p>
<p>
If for some reason the four wheel drive light does not go on,
the first thing to check is your seat belt.  For some reason
on some Wranglers, the four wheel drive light does not work with
the seat belt off.</p>
<p>
If you have your seat belt on and the light still is not on and
you have seen that there no power to the front axle, chances are
it is the vacuum motor.  If you have a bad line, you might be
able to engage four wheel drive by switching the hoses around.
If that doesn't work, it might be time to clean out the motor
and sleave that slides between the two parts of the axle shaft.
</p>

<p>
<strong><font size=5>Clunking Front End on Turns</font><br></strong>
Here are a couple common sources of clunking in the front end:
<ol type=1>
<li>
The spring leaves shift when turn and hit the leaf spring clamps.</li>
<li>
On the new Jeeps, it is common for the track bar mounts to elongate.
When the mounts elongate, the track bar clunks when going around
turns and hitting bumps.</li>
<li>
One of your front wheels is about to fall off, did you remember
to tighten those lugs?</li>
<li>
The hood is shifting on loose hinges.  If fixed tired hinges by
hammering them on the ends.</li>
</ol>
</p>


<p>
<strong><font size=5>Cold CJ</font></strong><br>
<font size=2>from Jeff Wilson</font><br>
During cold winters with a soft top, things can get pretty
nippy in a CJ.  Upgrade the small stock heater motor with
a <a href="/body/heater.html">
Chevy heater motor</a>
</p>

<p>
<strong><font size=5>CJ/YJ Doors Interchangable</font></strong><br>
<font size=2>from Jeff Wilson</font><br>
With the right striker, CJ doors fit the YJ and YJ doors fit the
CJ.  The best doors have the paddle latch used from 1980 on.
</p>

<p>
<strong><font size=5>Wet 258 (4.2L) Distributor</font></strong><br>
<font size=2>from Tom Wanamaker</font><br>
The Motorcraft distributor used on the 258 (4.2L) I6 has opening for
vacumn advance that allows water in.  If you drive though 2-3 inches
of water at 15-20 mph, it is likely your distributor will get wet.
It can take a few days for it to completely dry out.  If you run a
bead of RTV around the edge of the cap before installation and gob
some all-purpose grease around the vacuum advance hole, your
distributor will stay dry.
</p>

<p>
<strong><font size=5>Use the Right Fluids</font></strong><br>
<font size=2>from Tom Wanamaker</font><br>
Buy a service manual and use the right fluids.  All manual transmissions
use regular gear lube except the T-5 which uses ATF.  All gear driven
transfer cases use gear lube and all chain driven transfer cases
use ATF.  All the New Process/New Venture transfer cases used in
late model Jeeps are chain driven and they use ATF.  The Borg-Warner
Quadra-Trac transfer case used in the 70s uses special lube.
</p>


<p>
<strong><font size=5>Whistling 258 (4.2L)</font></strong><br>
<font size=2>from Tom Wanamaker</font><br>
If your late model 258 (4.2L) engine starts a high pitch/loud
whistling, and changes pitch with the throttle, check the PCV
hose between the carb and valve cover.  The bottom/inside tends
to bake and cave in.  There is a recall on this item for many
Jeeps.
</p>


<p>
<strong><font size=5>CJ Calipers</font></strong><br>
The calipers on on CJs equipped with disk brakes are makred "L" and
"R" and the instructions included with new calipers will say to
put the "L" one on the drivers side and the "R" one on the
passenger side.  Ignore these instructions and put them on
the other side so the bleeder is at the highest point.  If the
bleeder is not at the highest point, they will be nearly impossible
to bleed.
</p>


<p>
<strong><font size=5>Whistling Wrangler</font></strong><br>
The fuel injected Wrangler YJs and TJs have the loudest
fuel pumps that could be built.  Normally, you don't notice
it on the road, but off-road they are pretty loud.  Do
not be concerned by this noise, it is normal.
