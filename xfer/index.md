# Jeep Transfer Cases Page
## Factory Options
<H4>by [Terry L. Howe](mailto:txh3202@worldnet.att.net)</H4>
In order to narrow the scope of work to put these articles together,
they were originally written to cover only the transfer cases found in
CJs, YJs, and TJs.  The scope is being expanded to cover transfer
cases used in all Jeep models.
[NP242](/xfer/np242.html):  The NP242, also
known as the NV242, is a full-time transfer case used in Cherokees (XJ)
and Grand Cherokees (ZJ).
![NP231](/xfer/np231bT.jpg)
[NP231](/xfer/np231.html):  Since 1988, the NP231
has been the "Command Trac" transfer case used in Cherokees (XJ),
Comanches (MJ), and Wranglers (YJ).  It has been the "Command Trac"
transfer case in the Grand Cherokee (ZJ) since its introduction.  The
new Wrangler (TJ) continues to use the NP231.
![NP207](/xfer/np207bT.jpg)
[NP207](/xfer/np207.html):  The NP207 was used in
the first year of Wranglers in 1987.  It was used in Cherokees (XJ)
until from '84-'87.
[NP208](/xfer/np208.html):  The NP208 was used in
early 80s full size Cherokees, Grand Wagoneers, and J-series pickups.
![Dana 300](/xfer/d300bT.jpg)
[Dana 300](/xfer/d300.html):  The Dana 300 was
used only in CJs from 1980 until 1986.
![13-39 back](/xfer/bw13393_.jpg)
[BW 13-39](/xfer/qtrac.html):  The BW 13-39
"Quadra-Trac" was used in the CJ-7 from 1976 until 1979 and earlier in
other models.  It was introduced in the early 70s in full size
Jeep trucks, but it was not used after 1979 in any Jeep trucks.
![Dana 20](/xfer/d20bT.jpg)
[Dana 20](/xfer/d20.html):  The Dana 20 was
used in CJs from 1972 until 1979.  It was introduced in larger Jeep
trucks in the 60s, but it wasn't used in any Jeep trucks after 1979.
![Dana 18](/xfer/d18b_.jpg)
[Dana 18](/xfer/d18.html):  The Spicer/Dana 18
was used on the first CJs and their military counter parts until 1971.
It was also used on all other trucks until around 1965.
