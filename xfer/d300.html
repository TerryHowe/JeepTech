<br>

<P>
The Dana 300 is a heavy duty gear driven transfer
case that takes a 23 spline input shaft.  The case is cast
iron with a number C300-15 and the tail housing is aluminum.
The output for the front driveshaft on the Dana 300 is on the
passenger side and the rear output is centered.  Low range
is 2.62:1 and high is 1.00:1.
<p>
The bolt pattern is the same as many New Process transfer
cases, but the drop is on the opposite side.  Most New Process
transfer cases used on Jeeps have the round bolt pattern and
23 spline input so it is compatible to some extent.  The
difference is all the New Process transfer cases are drivers
drop and the Dana 300 is passenger drop.  Some drilling and
or tapping may be necessary may be necessary in the transfer
case or the adapter to "clock" the transfer case.  One bolt
hole in the pattern is offset to allow the transfer cases to
only be bolted on one way.  The other option is to not use
the bolt that clocks the transfer case.</p>
<P>
One way people modify the Dana 300 is by adding oil paddles
to the main shaft.  The oil paddles prevent oil starvation
of the rear bearing when flat towing.  Another possible
modification to the Dana 300 is converting it to
<A href="d300ub.html"> u-bolt yokes</A> rather than strap yokes.

<h3>Usage</h3>
<P>
The Dana 300 was used only in CJs from 1980 until 1986.
The first year the Dana 300 was available there was
a slight difference from transfercases used in '81â€“'86 CJs.
The 1980 Dana 300 features a shorter tail housing which allows
a slightly longer rear driveshaft.</p>
