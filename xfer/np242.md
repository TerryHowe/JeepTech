# Jeep Transfer Case: NP242/NVG242
The NP242 has an aluminum case and it should have a tag on
the back saying New Process Gear, Model 242.  New versions
of the NP242 are refered to as NVG242 or NV242 which stands
for New Venture Gear.  The tag on the back of the transfer
case will reflect the name change.  Only the name is different.
The chain driven NP242 is a full time transfer case with
a 48/52 torque split front and rear.  It is possible to lock
it into four low so it behaves like a part-time transfer
case.  When it is locked in, power will be split regardless
of traction.  The output for the front axle is on the drivers side.
Low range is 2.72 and high is 1.00.
### Usage
The NP242 is used in Grand Cherokees (ZJ) and Cherokees (XJ).
