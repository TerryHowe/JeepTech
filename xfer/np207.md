# Jeep Transfer Case: NP207

The NP207
has a aluminum case and an appearance similar to the
NP231.
It should have a tag on the back saying New Process Gear,
Model 207.
This chain driven transfer case uses a 21 spline input
with the manual transmissions and a 23 spline input with the
automatic transmissions.
The output for the front driveshaft is on the drivers side.
Low
range is 2.61 and high is 1.00.
This transfer case is widely scorned.
If yours should
break, look for a 21 spline NP231 or swap transmission
and transfer case at the same time.
The transfer case is
upsidedown in the picture showing the input (it is drivers
drop.)

### Usage
The NP207 was used in the first year of Wranglers in 1987.
It was used in Cherokees (XJ) until from '84â€“'87.
