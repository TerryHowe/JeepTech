<P>
The Dana 300 was used in CJs from 1980 until
1986 is probably the best all around transfer available in
the CJ.  It features a heavy duty cast iron case, gear drive,
and a respectable 2.62:1 low.  It shares a flexible input pattern
that is used with many of the modern transfer cases of today and
it's helical cut gears operate quietly.  There are always ways
of improving a good thing though, fortunately for the Dana 300,
the improvement is easy and fairly inexpensive.
<P>
The only mistake Jeep made putting the Dana 300 in the CJ was
by changing from U-bolt yokes used on the Dana 20 to strap type
yokes.  The straps tend to loosen and break easier than the
U-bolt yokes.  Converting the Dana 300 to U-bolt yokes doesn't
cost too much and it requires only a few common tools.  The tools
required include:
<UL>
<LI>
1/4" 12 pt. socket and socket wrench to remove strap bolts.</li>
<LI>
1 1/8" socket and socket wrench to turn it.  This is needed to remove
and replace the yoke retaining nut.
<LI>
18" pipe wrench or other wrench large enough to clamp on to the yoke.</li>
<LI>
1/2" open end wrench to tighten U-bolts.
<LI>
Torque wrench to tighten retaining nut.</li>
</UL>
<P>
I've heard that the yokes from a Dana 20 will fit on the Dana 300,
so if you have a Dana 20 with decent U-bolt yokes or if you can find
one in the core pile at your local yard, you might save some money.
I just went out and bought new yokes since I didn't have a Dana 20.
Part of the motivation for this project was to replace a bad yoke
that had been damaged and no longer held the u-joint firmly causing
some driveline vibration.  I ordered two yokes (Spicer part 2-4-2461X)
and two U-bolt kits (Spicer part 2-94-28X).  When I installed the
yoke on the front output, I found that the flange protecting the
seal was too large.  I hammered it off and used the flange from the
old yoke.  There probably is a part that will perfectly replace
the front yoke, but I do not know the part number.
<P>
Here is the step-by-step process of replacing the yokes:
<OL>
<LI>
Block tires so your Jeep doesn't roll away.</li>
<LI>
Remove the driveshafts with 1/4" 12 pt. socket
<LI>
Hold the old yoke with the pipe wrench while removing the yoke retaining nut
with 1 1/8" socket.</li>
<LI>
Remove old yoke and slide on new yoke.
<LI>
Hold new yoke with pipe wrench while tightening yoke retaining nut to 120
ft/lbs (162 N/M)</li>
<LI>
Reinstall drive shafts with U-bolts and tighten with 1/2" wrench.</li>
</OL>

<P>
I did the rear first and then removed the skid plate/cross member to
do the front, after properly supporting the transmission of course.
I think that the yoke retaining nuts should technically be replaced
since they are locking nuts, but I reused mine with no problems.
