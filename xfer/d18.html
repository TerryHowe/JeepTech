<p>
The Spicer/Dana 18 is a gear driven transfer case that comes in 5
slightly different variations.  The early version of the Dana 18
had a 27 tooth drive gear and 3/4" intermediate shaft and 1.98:1
low.  The second generation Dana 18 came with a 26 tooth input
gear and 3/4" intermediate shaft and 2.42:1 low.
The third generation Dana 18 came with a 26 tooth input
gear and 1-1/8" intermediate shaft and 2.42:1 low.  The fourth
generation Dana 18, uses a 26 tooth input gear, 1-1/4" intermediate
shaft, and 2.42:1 low range.  The fifth generation Dana 18 uses a
29 tooth input gear, 1-1/4" intermediate shaft, used a larger input
hole, the same case used in the Dana 20, and has a 2.46:1 low range.
The big hole input is about 4" in diameter where as the small hole
input is about 3" in diameter.  All Dana 18 cases are cast iron.</p>
</p>
<p>
The small hole Dana 18s are interchangable, but the input gear
must match the transfer case.  The big hole Dana 18 can be bolted
on a transmission that was originally coupled with a Dana 20
and visa-versa.  All Dana 20 and Dana 18 input gears are 6 spline
except ones used with the 10 spline version of the
<a href="/trans/t14.html"> T-14</a> transmission.
All Dana 18s and Dana 20s use the 5 bolt "Texas" bolt pattern.
</p>
</p>
<p>
All Dana 18s have front and rear outputs offset to the passenger side.
Trucks built with a Dana 18 have a rear axle that is offset to the
passenger side.  Most other transfer cases used in Jeeps have a
centered rear output that couples directly with the input shaft so
that no gears are turning when in high range 2WD.  The Dana 18 always
has gears turning which makes it wear faster, noisier, and not quite
as strong as some other Jeep transfer cases.  It is still a strong unit,
just not as strong as some other Jeep transfer cases.

<p>
A unique feature of the the Dana 18 is the
<a href="/convxfer/warnod.html">overdrive</a>,
developed by Warn, that attaches in the PTO port in the back.  There
are also <a href="/winch/d18pto.html">PTO attachments</a>
that can be used to drive <a href="/winch">winches</a>,
generators, welders, assorted farm implements, and about anything else
you can imagine that might accept PTO input.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
The Spicer/Dana 18 was used on the first CJs and their military counter
parts until 1971.  It was also used on all other trucks until
around 1965.  During the late 60s, many of the larger trucks
were built with the Dana 20.  The MBs and GPWs used in WWII
used the 27 tooth Dana 18.  The CJ-2A up to serial number #24196
in early 1946 used the 26 tooth, 3/4" intermediate shaft Dana 18.
CJ-2As after than and the CJ-3A and
CJ-3B (to serial number 54-12506) use the 26 tooth input gear
and 1-1/8" intermediate shaft.  The Dana 18 with a 1 1/4"
intermediate shaft and 26 tooth input gear was used on
the CJ-3B (after serial number 54-12506), CJ-5, CJ-5A, CJ-6, and
CJ-6A.  The big hole Dana 18 was used with Jeeps equipped with
the Dauntless V6 engine.  It is not clear if the big hole Dana 18
was ever used with the 134 I4 and T-90 combination, they probably
continued to use the small hole Dana 18 with the T-90.  The big hole
Dana 18 uses the same cast iron case that is used on the Dana 20.</p>
