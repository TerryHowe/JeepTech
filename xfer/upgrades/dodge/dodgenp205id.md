# Dodge NP205

The NP205 transfer case is a heavy duty gear driven transfer case in a cast iron case. The low range is 1.98:1 and it was used from 1971 until 1980 in Dodge trucks. The transfer case has a poor low range, but may be useful in situations where strength is more important than crawl ratio.

The NP205 is still used in some heavy duty Dodge trucks. Some versions of the NP205 are drivers drop and some are passenger drop. There are variations in input spline count and some NP205s are divorce mounted.
