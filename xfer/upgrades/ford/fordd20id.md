The Ford Dana 20 transfer case is gear driven with a cast iron case. It was used in early Broncos from 1966 until 1977 and it was used in some Ford pickups. It is drivers drop and it was available with a couple different low range ratios all around 2.4:1.

The Ford Dana 20 looks a lot different than the Jeep Dana 20. The Jeep Dana 20 is passenger drop of course, but that isn\'t the only difference. Parts from the Ford Dana 20 can be used convert a Jeep Dana 20 to have a better low range. Two write ups on this conversion are located at [http://www.off-road.com/\~jweed/transfer.html](https://www.off-road.com/~jweed/transfer.html) and [http://www.srv.net/\~jrcase/mod20.html](https//www.srv.net/~jrcase/mod20.html){target="nontech"}
