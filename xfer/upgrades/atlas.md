The Atlas transfer case is a new development from Advanced Adapters. It is gear driven with an aluminum case. The internals are similar to a Dana 300 except it has a low range reduction of 3.7:1 and lower. They have version for the Wrangler and should have versions for earlier CJs available at this time.
