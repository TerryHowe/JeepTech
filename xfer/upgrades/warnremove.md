# Removing The Saturn/Warn Overdrive

![Warn Overdrive front](/images/transmission/updates/WODf_.jpg)

I get confused everytime I remove a Warn (aka Saturn) over drive from a Dana 18 transfer case that was in a Jeep or Scout 80. Looking at the exploded view from Advanced Adapters helps, but sometimes I still get it wrong and I have to figure it out all over again. I figured if I wrote up the procedure, I wouldn\'t forget again and at least I\'d have something to look up.

-   Remove the five bolts that run through the case of the over drive with a 9/16\" socket.
-   Pry the over drive case away from the Dana 18 case. Keep in mind that the gasket sealer and the bearing that rides in the planetary hub assembly may fight a bit.
-   Remove special snap ring that is behind and can be seen through the planetaries.
-   Remove the special lock washer that is behind the snap ring with some needle nose pliers.
-   Use long 1/2\" extension to remove planetary hub assembly from transmission output shaft.
