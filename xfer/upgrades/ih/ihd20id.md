# IH Dana 20

The Dana 20 transfer case used in IH Scouts and trucks is bolt compatible with most Jeep trucks. The Scout 800 used the Dana 20 from mid 60s when it was introduced until 1972. The Scout II and related models used the Dana 20 from 1972 until 1979. The only real difference between the versions used in the Jeep and the Scout is the shift linkage. A neat part about the Dana 20 used in some early Scout 800s is it came from the factory with a twin stick shifter.
