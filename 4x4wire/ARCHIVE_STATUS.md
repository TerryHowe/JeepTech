## What's Missing ✗

### Images Not Archived (146 image references)

The Wayback Machine did not capture these images when archiving the site. They are referenced in the HTML but the image files don't exist in any archived snapshot.

**Major Missing Categories:**
- Engine project photos (7 thumbnails)
- Frame modification details (6 thumbnails)
- Damage assessment photos (9 thumbnails)
- Suspension work photos (2 thumbnails)
- Paint/Durabak photos (5 thumbnails)
- Transfer case details (3 thumbnails)
- Battery setup details (3 thumbnails)
- Transmission work details (6 thumbnails)
- Tech section diagrams (~50 images)
- Review/comparison images (~30 images)

## Why Images Are Missing

The Wayback Machine archives web pages at specific timestamps. When it takes a snapshot:
1. It saves the HTML page
2. It attempts to save referenced images
3. **But not all images get captured** due to:
   - Loading delays
   - Robots.txt restrictions
   - Broken links at time of archival
   - Server timeouts
   - Image hosting on different servers
