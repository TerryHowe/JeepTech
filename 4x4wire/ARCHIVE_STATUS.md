## Why Images Are Missing

The Wayback Machine archives web pages at specific timestamps. When it takes a snapshot:
1. It saves the HTML page
2. It attempts to save referenced images
3. **But not all images get captured** due to:
   - Loading delays
   - Robots.txt restrictions
   - Broken links at time of archival
   - Server timeouts
   - Image hosting on different servers

## Current Archive Quality

## Can Missing Images Be Retrieved?

**Unlikely.** We tried:
- ✅ Multiple Wayback Machine timestamps (9 different dates)
- ✅ Both HTTP and HTTPS versions
- ✅ With and without 'www' subdomain
- ❌ None of the missing images exist in the archive

**Alternative sources:**
- The original 4x4wire.com site is offline

- Some content might be on other Jeep forums where it was shared

## Recommendation

This archive is best used for:
- ✅ Reading the CJ-2A build documentation and tech articles
- ✅ Understanding project scope and sequence
- ✅ Following technical procedures described in text
- ⚠️ Visual reference (limited - many project photos missing)

The text content is complete and valuable, but visual documentation is limited to about 17% of original images.
