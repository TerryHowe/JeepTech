I've had a lot of Jeeps over the years and a lot of radios in those
Jeeps.  Locking up your valuables and keeping a radio working in the
Jeep has always been a challenge.  Tuffy Stereo Center Console
provides the security for the radio, a secure place for valuables,
protection from the elements, and an arm rest.  The Tuffy Deluxe
Stereo Security Console offers a lot in a well built and finished product.
There are some cool new features to the console, but the assembly and
installation is just as easy as it has ever been.
</p>
<p class="headline">Why Use the Tuffy Stereo Console</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Security is important when you own a soft top Jeep. My '75 CJ
didn't even have a locking glove box and most locking space on newer
Wranglers just uses easy to break plastic doors.  It sure is nice to
have a place to throw my wallet or other valuables once in a while
when I don't want to carry them around.  The console is great for this.
I also can keep the stereo secure in the console.  In the dash, it
really only takes a minute or two to remove a stereo.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The console also provides great protection from the elements for
the stereo and my stuff.  The weatherstripping makes it very dust and
moisture resistant.  I don't know how many Jeeps I've had that have had
water leaks behind the dash at one time or another.  Normally, that
happens when the fresh air vent gets clogged with leaves and the water
starts pouring in.  If the radio doesn't get trashed right away, it
normally is only a matter of time.  Dust also kills the radios.  The
moving parts get jammed up with dust and you can clean it out one or
two times, but after a while no amount of air or other cleaners will
make them work properly again.  The console, you can close up the
stereo and keep it pretty sealed off from trail dust and moisture.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Another great reason to use the stereo console is in earlier Jeeps,
like my '75, the dash had no provision for a radio in it.  Most people
cut and drill the dash for a radio, but I didn't want to modify my
dash.  With the stereo console, I didn't have to ruin the dash.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Lets not forget the arm rest.  You really need to look detached and
disinterested when you are driving around the coolest Jeep in town because
that just makes you look cooler.  The Tuffy console comes with a nice thick
padded arm rest to give you that look.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Another great reason to buy Tuffy products is they are made in the
USA!
</p>
<p class="headline">New Features</p>
<p class="bodytext">
It had been several years since I had worked with a Tuffy console and
I was pleased to see they had made some improvements over those years.
The biggest improvement was the new locking system.  While the older
round locks are very secure, they are bulky on the key chain.  Tuffy
is now using a flat key with a push button lock.  Their "anti-twist"
lock design looks very secure and latches the top even if the console
isn't locked.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Another minor, but nice, feature is they are now stamping "Tuffy" into
the sheet metal of the console instead of using a sticker like they
have in the past.  This gives the console a cleaner and more professional
look.
</p>
<p class="headline">Assembly and Installation</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Assembly and installation for my Jeep was very easy, probably a bit
easier than most since I didn't have an old center console to remove.
Assembly of the console only requires sticking on the weather strip and
fastening on the cup holder.  I put the cup holder on the front where
it would be handy for the people up front.  I had to put it on the highest
set of holes to clear the shift levers.  I didn't attach the seat belt
straps because my early Jeep uses a different setup for seat belts.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
After the console was assembled, I put it in the Jeep and marked out the 
front hole.  I pulled out the console and drilled that hole.  After that
hole was drilled, I put the console back in and drilled the back two
holes with the console in place and a bolt through the front hole.  This
made it easy to line up all the holes.  I had my wife Diane help me tighten
down the bolts since it is pretty hard to do that yourself.  That is it, it
took all of a couple minutes.
</p>
<p class="headline">The Sound that Pounds</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The stereo I put in the console was just temporary until can afford
something better.  I had an old stereo sitting around that served in my
flat fender for a year  and in my CJ-7 before that.  The tape deck didn't
work, but the radio still did.  A friend gave it to me for free and it
was actually a pretty reliable stereo for a long time.  From my experience,
the cheaper stereos with the mechanical buttons for eject, fast forward,
and rewind last longer in Jeeps.  This one lasted a long time, but it
wouldn't play a tape anymore.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Wiring the stereo was fairly easy because I'd already run a wire for hot
all the time and a wire for hot on run.  You may also need to run a wire
for lights depending on your stereo.  I soldered and shrink wrapped all
the wires even though this installation was temporary, I hate electrical
problems!  I didn't bother running an antenna wire since I didn't have
an antenna, the radio picks up stations around town without the antenna.
Some &quot;nice&quot; Radio Shack speakers on the roll cage give the
sound that pounds.

The modification to the seat bracket.  A piece of angle welded to the round

    </td>

<p class="bodytext">
Installing a Tuffy console in a pre '75 Jeep is a little trickier than
later Jeeps, but I'd planned for this.  The tricky part is that the
drivers side seat bracket goes all the way across the front to the passenger
side.  I'd modified the transmission tunnel making the surface under
the console all flat.  I'd also cut down the drivers side seat bracket
and made it drop down and end as short as possible.  This gave me a
nice flat mounting surface and no seat bracket in the way for the console.
<p class="bodytext">
It would be tough to mount the console in there without at least modifying
the seat bracket.  You could do it if you mounted the console on top of the
seat belt bolts, but that didn't seem to be a good idea to me.  I had enough
room after the seat bracket was modified for the 8&quot; wide console.  A
wider console would require also modifying the passenger side seat bracket.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The other odd thing about my installation is I'd increased the size of the
transmission tunnel so that it was flat all underneath the console.  This made
it so I just drilled straight through the floor and I did not need to use the
foot bracket.  I think the console could be mounted without modifying the
tunnel, but you'd need to use the foot bracket or something on the drivers
side of the console.  On earlier CJs, the fuel tank under the drivers seat
would probably get in the way.
</p>

<p class="headline">Conclusion</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Well my mind hasn't changed, I still think Tuffy products are great!  Nice
finish and rugged construction makes them the console of choice for my Jeeps.
