Is your Jeep awkward to get in?  When you start putting bigger tires and
a lift kit on your rig, it can be pretty hard to get in and out.  Sure, you
could put steps on the rig, but they generally hurt your break over angle
and they often get damaged four wheeling.  Redneck Concepts has come up with a 
solution to this problem, the The Cowboy StirrUP Step&reg;.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The step is a great way to get in and out of your Jeep.  The step
hangs from a hook off the door opening of the Jeep.  When you aren't
using the step, you unhook it and push it under the seat or throw it in the
back.  It isn't in the way when you are not using it.  A standard step,
you have to worry about them getting caught on a rock
and you have to worry about damaging the step four wheeling.  With the
The Cowboy StirrUP Step&reg;, it is only there when you need it.

<p class="bodytext">
Looking at the step, my first thought was I was going to bang my shin on
the side of the tub.  My wife, Diane, thought the same thing, but it just
doesn't happen.  It is easy to swing up and into the Jeep with the step.
It is a lot less stressful on the knees and arms to use the step because
you don't need to be a contortionist to get in your Jeep.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
We've been using the step for a month now and it has been
great.  I'd highly recommend them for anyone that does not want to 
compromise for comfort or for performance.  You just don't need to
compromise at all with the The Cowboy Stirrup Step&reg;.
