When I swapped a 4.3L Chevy V6 in to replace the 3.8L Buick V6, I had to rework
the intermediate shaft.  The Chevy engine mounts are in the middle where as the
Buick mounts are in the front of the engine.  The only way I could clear the
engine mount was with a three u-joint intermediate shaft from Borgeson.
</p>
<p class="headline">Column</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The steering column I originally used in my CJ-2A was from a late 70s full
size Cherokee.  When I did the engine swap, I realized the column was too
long and there was no way to move it up.  CJ steering columns are at least
an inch shorter than the full size Jeep steering column I was using, so I
decided to install a CJ steering column.  When I tried to bolt it in, I
noticed that the dash bracket used on the CJ was wider than the bracket on
the Cherokee.  Fortunately, the Cherokee bracket bolted right on the CJ column
so I was able to use the shorter column.  The CJ column was not a tilt column,
but it was in good shape and I had the key.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The real comedy of the operation was when I went to repair the turn signal
on the CJ steering column.  It had a Grant steering wheel on it, so I removed
the steering wheel and decided to try to remove the adapter with two screw
drivers rather than use a puller.  The adapter came right off, but with enough
force to give me a Harry Potter style cut on my forehead.  I always remember
to use a puller to get those adapters off anymore.
</p>
<p class="headline">Intermediate Shaft</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I called up Borgeson and let them know what I was trying to do.  They sent
me out a bunch of parts and they sent me two splined shafts because I couldn't
tell which one I would need.  The parts needed for a 3 u-joint intermediate
shaft are the heim joint for the fixed shaft.  The round shaft slides through
the heim joint.  A collapsible shaft is also needed to absorb flex between
the body and frame.  The collapsable shaft is the free shaft.  Three u-joints
connect the two shafts.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
As it turned out, one of the u-joints was not correct.  I ran out to my
local hot rod shop that stocks Borgeson parts, but all they had was a u-joint
that was correct on one side.  I bought it anyway, because the Borgeson u-joints
can be disassembled.  I took apart the two u-joints and put them back together
with the two ends that had the proper spline counts.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
To set up the fixed half of the intermediate shaft,
I cut a short piece of 2&quot;x2&quot; square tubing and drilled it out for the
heim joint.  I set it up so the shaft had plenty of room to clear the exhaust
manifold and the engine mount.  I just clamped the square tubing to the frame
and welded it on.
</p>
<p class="headline">Conclusion</p>
<p class="bodytext">
It really took less than one night to assemble the shaft which is a good
thing because I had to go wheeling.  The Borgeson u-joints are so much nicer
moving than the stock bell coupling and cheap-o stock u-joint.  Setting up
any three u-joint intermediate shaft is real easy using the Borgeson parts,
I just need to make sure I order the right spline counts next time!
