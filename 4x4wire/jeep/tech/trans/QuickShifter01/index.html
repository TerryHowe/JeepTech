If you've seen the latest Big Rock video from the ARCA finals in Farmington
New Mexico, you've seen a lot of roll overs.  There are also some amazing
saves in there.  In several of the roll overs, the drivers attempt to shift
into reverse when the front tires come off the ground, but they miss shift or
shift too late.  Some of the rolls probably could not have been saved, but some
could of been saved if the driver was able to shift correctly and shift
quicker.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
This ability to shift quickly has interested me since I rolled on "Black
Widow" out in the Rock Garden of Farmington, New Mexico.  I'm not sure if I
would of saved the roll, but I hit park instead of reverse and blipped the
throttle.  That didn't help.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I was using a Daytona cheap-o-shifter that ran me about $45.  It is completely
ungated except it locks in park.  Well, it used to lock in park, but the pin
sheared and it didn't even do that anymore.  Anyway, when trying to shift
quickly with this shifter, you always have to count the clicks you feel
from the transmission to guess which gear you are in.  It isn't easy to do if
you are in a hurry.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
To solve the problem, I purchased a cable operated shifter from Art Carr
Performance Products.  This shifter is very durable and all the gates in it
are created by the shifter cover.  I installed the shifter and used a cut off
wheel to remove the gates that I didn't want.  The first time around, I only
removed the gate between neutral and third.  This was pretty good, and you
can see the picture of the shifter with the gate removed on the lower right,
but a month after that, I also cut the gate out between second and third.
With these two gates removed, I can shift very quickly between first and
reverse.
<p class="bodytext">
I have not needed to test it to see if it really works, but I really like the
way it shifts between first and reverse.  When you are four wheeling, this
always seems to be the shift you are making and I can really slam gears with
no missed shifts.  The only thing I didn't like about the Art Carr shifter
over the Daytona shifter is the way the linkage ties in.  The cable is nice
and beefy, but the cable comes in from the bottom where as the Daytona shifter
had a rod that come in from the top.  You don't have to worry about hitting
the rod at all, but the cable bracket and shifter hanging down which is not
as nice.  Fortunately, in first gear, the arm on the shifter is all the way
back, so for normal four wheeling, it is not likely I will hit the arm.
<p class="bodytext">
This set up would work a bit better for a Jeep with a drivers drop transfer
case, but I have a passenger drop transfer case.  The front drive shaft and
transfer case would help protect the shift linkage if I had a drivers drop
transfer case, so it would be less of an issue.  Either way, I have not hit
the linkage yet.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
On the right is a picture of the linkage.  It doesn't hang down lower than
the pan on my TH350, but it is slightly exposed.  I don't have a skid plate
under my transmission, just a piece of 3/16" steel welded to the transmission
pan.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Installing the shifter body was super easy.  Since it is a cable operated
shifter, you can put it where ever you want.  I just screwed the shifter
body down on my tunnel cover.  The shifter body covered up the hole I had
for my old Daytona shifter.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
So, if you get a chance to watch the Big Rock video from Farmington, keep quick
shifts in mind.  Watch Matt Peterson in his yellow CJ-7 go over backwards, he
hits neutral and revs the engine.   Matt has a column shifter.  Watch Shannon
Campbell on the same obstacle do a wheel stand and jam it in reverse, he saves
it.  I'm pretty sure, but not positive, that Shannon has an Art Carr shifter.
To be fair to Matt, I don't think he would of saved it anyway, but at least he
would of hit reverse when he tried.  With the Art Carr shifter, I know I'll
get the right gear and I'll get it as quick as I can shift it.
