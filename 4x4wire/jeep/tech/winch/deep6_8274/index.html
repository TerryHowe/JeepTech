I heard through a fellow Internet Jeeper that Predator Four Wheel Drive in
Colorado Springs was running a special on some brand new Warn 8274 winches.
The winches were the old style with the old motor and old solenoid pack, but
they were only $699.  I had the same winch on my flat fender and CJ-7 for
years and I loved it.  I couldn't pass up the the opportunity to put one on
my CJ-6.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
A lot of people will ask me if they have any more of these winches.  I'm sorry
to say, the answer is no.  There were only a limited number and they sold pretty
fast.  When these deals come around, it is well worth jumping on them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
My CJ-6, also known as Deep Six, is mostly stock with a single battery and
the 258 has the stock alternator.  The alternator is the &quot;heavy duty&quot;
version producing 60 or so amps.  The alternator seams to do pretty well with
this winch, I didn't see a reason to do an upgrade it.  It would be nice
to have a dual battery, but I knew my single Interstate battery would do
the job in most situations.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I happened to have my <a href="/jeep/reviews/rockware98/">RockWare
Bumper</a> from my '81 CJ-7 sitting around and this was the perfect opportunity
to put it back in action.  I did have to slightly modify the bumper to work
with the CJ-6 though.  The frame rails are the same width between the CJ-6
and the CJ-7, but the bolt lay out is a bit different.  These differences would
be the same for any '72-'76 CJ vs any '77-'86 CJ.  One of the bolts in the
side is in a different place, so I drilled both sides of the bumper/winch mount
for the new location.
<p class="bodytext">
The other difference was with the way the steering box attaches.  The RockWare
bumper sits low over the front cross member which works on the CJ-7, but on
the '72-'76 CJs the steering box bracket has bolts through the top.  These
bolts hit on the bumper/winch mount and prevented it from going down far enough.
To solve this problem, I used a small hole saw to cut out the top to provide
space for the steering box bracket bolt heads.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
After the bumper/winch mount was attached, it was easy to bolt up the winch
and run the cables to the battery.  The winch saw a lot of action on a work
trip out on Hacket Gulch.  We were clearing up a bunch of dead fall and blocking
off illegal trails and I had to winch several times pulling dead trees out of
the forest.  The whole system worked well even with the stock alternator and
one battery.  The winch also saved me when frame flex caused me to loose my
clutch linkage.</p>
