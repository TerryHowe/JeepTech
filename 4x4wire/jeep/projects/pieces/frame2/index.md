New body mounts

Frame work wasn't done after simply chopping up and splicing together the '73 Commando frame to flat fender specifications. There was still a large frame crack to fix near the front spring mount, the splices to reinforce, body mounts to build, and some frame boxing to do.

## Frame Cracks

Someone must of caught so big air with that Commando because it had a large frame crack just behind the front fixed spring hanger. This is a fairly common places for these frames to crack. I welded up the crack, but to stop future cracks, I wanted to reinforce the area.
I was also concerned about have a straight verticle weld on the frame since it was likely to cause stress cracks around the weld. I had a similar situation where I had spliced the frame together. The common solution is to weld a fish mouthed gusset over the weld so that the stresses are distributed over a wider area.

Inverse fish mouth

Near the back, the frame curved up where I was going to be putting this fish mouth, so I decided to try an inverse fish mouth. I cut a piece of 3"x3/16" steel so the ends were pointed and ran the piece all the way on the outside of the frame rail from one spring to the other. I stitch welded it every 6" or so. The 3/16" is probably overkill, a 1/8" piece should be more than enough, but the material was handy.

## Body Mounts

When I was cutting up the frame, I cut off all the body mounts because the layout wouldn't work for my needs. Since I needed to build a new floor for my tub, I put the body mounts in places that were convenient for me and would add the most strength. I used the mounts that I cut off and just welded them on top of the 3/16" steel I had welded on for frame reinforcement.

One of the rear mounts I was able to keep in place and the far back mount needed to be fabricated. I used some 2"x2" square tubing to make the back body mount. I moved the mounts from there stock location inside the frame rails. The stock location of the rear body mounts for flat fenders have a tendancy to rip off and in fact mine were ripped completely off when I bought the Jeep.

I used the same 2"x2" square tubing to build new body mounts for the grill. I reinforced the grill with some 2"x2" angle welded a nut inside the tubing so the bolts run down. The grill is sturdy enough now that it could stand up on its own for street use at least.

## Frame Boxing

Frame boxing

I was pretty tired of doing frame work when my friend Roger Wild stopped by to see how I was doing. He drives an early 70s CJ-5, so his framee was very similar. He said I should box the unboxed rear section of the frame or I will most likely get cracks. I was disappointed to hear this, but took his advice.

I used some 1/8"x&8" steel and cut ot to the contors of the frame. I used the angle grinder to perfect the shape and get the paint off the frame. After that, I simply weled the curved plate to the outside edge of the C channel. This should add plenty of strenght to the frame in this area.
