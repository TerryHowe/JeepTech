Frame work wasn't done after simply chopping up and splicing
together the '73 Commando frame to flat fender specifications.
There was still a large frame crack to fix near the front
spring mount, the splices to reinforce, body mounts to build,
and some frame boxing to do.</p>

<p class="headline">Frame Cracks</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Someone must of caught so big air with that Commando because
it had a large frame crack just behind the front fixed spring
hanger.  This is a fairly common places for these frames to
crack.  I welded up the crack, but to stop future cracks,
I wanted to reinforce the area.
<p class="bodytext">
I was also concerned about have a straight verticle weld on
the frame since it was likely to cause stress cracks around
the weld.  I had a similar situation where I had spliced the
frame together.  The common solution is to weld a fish mouthed
gusset over the weld so that the stresses are distributed over
a wider area.</p>

Near the back, the frame curved up where I was going to be
putting this fish mouth, so I decided to try an inverse fish
mouth.  I cut a piece of 3&quot;x3/16&quot; steel so the ends
were pointed and ran the piece all the way on the outside
of the frame rail from one spring to the other.  I stitch
welded it every 6&quot; or so.  The 3/16&quot; is probably
overkill, a 1/8&quot; piece should be more than enough, but
the material was handy.</p>

<p class="headline">Body Mounts</p>
<p class="bodytext">
When I was cutting up the frame, I cut off all the body mounts
because the layout wouldn't work for my needs.  Since I needed
to build a new floor for my tub, I put the body mounts in places
that were convenient for me and would add the most strength.
I used the mounts that I cut off and just welded them on top of
the 3/16&quot; steel I had welded on for frame reinforcement.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
One of the rear mounts I was able to keep in place and the far
back mount needed to be fabricated.  I used some 2&quot;x2&quot;
square tubing to make the back body mount.  I moved the mounts
from there stock location inside the frame rails.  The stock
location of the rear body mounts for flat fenders have a tendancy 
to rip off and in fact mine were ripped completely off when I
bought the Jeep.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I used the same 2&quot;x2&quot; square tubing to build new body
mounts for the grill.  I reinforced the grill with some 2&quot;x2&quot;
angle welded a nut inside the tubing so the bolts run down.  The
grill is sturdy enough now that it could stand up on its own for
street use at least.</p>

<p class="headline">Frame Boxing</p>

I was pretty tired of doing frame work when my friend Roger Wild
stopped by to see how I was doing.  He drives an early 70s CJ-5,
so his framee was very similar.  He said I should box the unboxed
rear section of the frame or I will most likely get cracks.  I
was disappointed to hear this, but took his advice.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I used some 1/8&quot;x&amp;8&quot; steel and cut ot to the contors
of the frame.  I used the angle grinder to perfect the shape and
get the paint off the frame.  After that, I simply weled the curved
plate to the outside edge of the C channel.  This should add plenty
of strenght to the frame in this area.</p>
