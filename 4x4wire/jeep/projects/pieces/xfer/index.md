What Jeep project is complete with out some IH Scout parts thrown in? It certainly wouldn't be Pieces and Parts without some Scout parts thrown in. I was searching for a transfer case when I noticed a Spicer 18 and Warn Overdrive sitting in the transfer case pile at my local junk yard. I asked about it and the owner told me it was from an '80 Scout. I knew the '80 Scout didn't use a Spicer 18, but the Scout 80 did. The Scout 80 was the first generate Scout built in the early 60s.

I asked how much he wanted for it and he said $200. I haggled a bit, but he wouldn't budge, I reluctantly agreed knowing full well the overdrive was worth well over $400 alone. He did remark about what a funny transfer case they used made of aluminum and cast iron.

The transfer case appeared to be in excellent shape as did the overdrive. I cleaned it up a bit and bolted it up. An intereesting part about the transfer case is it is a small hole case with a 1 1/4" intermediate shaft. Many people do not realize this version exists, they assume all 1 1/4" cases are large hole. Jeep used this case in the 60s as well before going with the large hole case in the late 60s.

The only left to do with the transfer case is bend the shift levers. It has a twin stick shifter and the levers are bent over so they hit the passengers leg in a small Jeep like a flat fender. I also managed to get the nice Scout twin stick shift boot in the deal. It is a bit thicker than the brand new twin stick boots sold for $30 each today.
