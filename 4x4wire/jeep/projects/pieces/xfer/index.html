What Jeep project is complete with out some IH Scout parts
thrown in?  It certainly wouldn't be Pieces and Parts without
some Scout parts thrown in.  I was searching for a transfer
case when I noticed a Spicer 18 and Warn Overdrive sitting
in the transfer case pile at my local junk yard.  I asked
about it and the owner told me it was from an '80 Scout.  I
knew the '80 Scout didn't use a Spicer 18, but the Scout 80
did.  The Scout 80 was the first generate Scout built in the
early 60s.</p>

I asked how much he wanted for it and he said $200.  I haggled
a bit, but he wouldn't budge, I reluctantly agreed knowing full
well the overdrive was worth well over $400 alone.  He did
remark about what a funny transfer case they used made of
aluminum and cast iron.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The transfer case appeared to be in excellent shape as did
the overdrive.  I cleaned it up a bit and bolted it up.
An intereesting part about the transfer case is it is a small
hole case with a 1 1/4" intermediate shaft.  Many people do
not realize this version exists, they assume all 1 1/4"
cases are large hole.  Jeep used this case in the 60s as well
before going with the large hole case in the late 60s.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<p class="bodytext">
The only left to do with the transfer case is bend the shift
levers.  It has a twin stick shifter and the levers are bent over
so they hit the passengers leg in a small Jeep like a flat fender.
I also managed to get the nice Scout twin stick shift boot in the
deal.  It is a bit thicker than the brand new twin stick boots sold
for $30 each today.</p>
