I decided right from the start to sell off the Dana 25 and Dana 41
that came with my flat fender and replace them with more modern
and stronger units.  I had heard stories of breakage with the old
axles since they use smaller shafts and low spline counts compared
to the stronger axles used in the 70s and 80s.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
Soon after I purchased the flat fender, I found a '72 CJ-5 in
one of those cut and crush junk yards.  The good news was the
axles where in good shape and had 4.27:1 R&P.;  I purchased the
front end for $50.  I kind of wanted a Dana 44 front end, but
the Dana 30 should stand up to the light weight and fairly
low horse power of my flat fender.  I couldn't beat the price
and the '72-'86 CJ Dana 30 is the strongest axle that bolts on
to a flat fender without cutting or other major fabrication.
The narrow track Dana 30 used from '72-'81 is slightly wider
than the Dana 25 and the wide track Dana 30 is wider yet.  The
width should not be a big issue, the fender will still be over the
tires and my turning radius, articulation, and stability should
improve.

The down side was the Dana 30 had drum brakes up front and my
heart was set on disks up front.  I happened to have a Dana 30
from an '81 CJ-5 with disks, but 3.54:1 R&P.;  To get the disks
and low gears, I decided to upgrade the older Dana 30 to disks.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
The disk conversion for the drum Dana 30 is quite simple, no
fabrication is required if you have the right parts.  The first
step is to strip both axles down to just the housing with
the gears in place.  To do this you must:
<span class="bodytext">
<ul>
<li><strong>Remove the hub/lockout:</strong>  On Warn premium hubs
you have to remove the cap screws and remove the dial.  Remove the
snap ring on the end of the axle shaft and remove the 6 bolts holding
it to the brake hub.</li>
<li><strong>Remove the brake hub and drum/rotor:</strong> First, you
have to hammer back the locking washer that holds the spindle nut in
place.  Remove the outside spindle nut, locking washer, inner spindle
nut, and inner washer.  A 2 1/16" spindle nut socket is the best tool
for removing the spindle nut.  Pull off the brake hub and
drum/rotor.</li>
<li><strong>Remove the Spindle:</strong>  On the drum brake, you
must remove all the springs, shoes, and brake hose at this time.
Brake tools pay
for themselves when assembling and disassembling drum brakes.
Six nuts hold the spindle to the knuckle.  Remove these nuts with
a 9/16" socket and begin the sometimes ardous task of removing
the spindle from the knuckle.  On the drum brake version, the
backing plate should pull
right off this time so you can hammer at the spindle with the backing
plate out of the way.  Try to get a chisel behind the spindle and/or
put an old spindle nut on the end and hit that.  You can also strike
the spindle on the part in between were the two bearings ride, but
if it is stuck firmly, this won't be enough.</li>
<li><strong>Pull the Shaft:</strong>  Once the spindle has been removed,
carefully slide the shaft out.</li>
<li><strong>Remove the knuckle:</strong>  Remove the cotter pins that
lock the ball joint nuts in place and remove the the two nuts.  You
should be able to pop the knuckle off by hitting it and the ball joint
end.  An old nut on the end of the ball joint can help protect the
end of the ball joints if they are still in good shape.</li>
</ul>
</span>
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
Once everything is apart, you are ready to put things back together.
I did some mixing a matching to get the strongest combination possible.
For me, the process for reassembly was slightly complicated for various
reasons.  The steps follow:</p>

<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Install Disk Brake Knuckles: </strong>
The first step was to install the knuckles with the caliper bracket.
Simply slide the ball joints in place and torque to spec.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Install Shafts: </strong>
Next I needed to install the shafts.  Both set of shafts were
of the same length, but the '81 CJ-5 Dana 30 uses a shaft that is
slightly thicker between the splines and yoke.  For this reason, I
decided to go with the newer shafts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The only problem was, One of the u-joints was badly frozen and needed
to be replaced.
Replacing the u-joint can be done with a bench vise, socket set, hammer,
and screwdriver.  The hammer and screwdriver are handy for removing
the old rusty clip that retains the u-joint.  After the four clips
are removed, I use a 11/16" socket and 1" socket to press out the
joint one way, remove the cap, and press out the joint the other way
to remove the other cap.  The little socket goes on the cap to be
pressed in and the big socket goes around the cap that is being pressed
out.  If the joints are stiff, apply pressure
and tap the side of the yoke with a hammer to slightly elongate the
yoke and the cap will pop.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The other u-joint was in good shape, so I left it in place.  The
shafts are easy to install, you just slide them in and try not to
damage the inner seal.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Install Spindles: </strong>
After the shafts are in place, the spindles can be installed.
The drum brake Dana 30 uses a slightly different spindle than the
disk brake version.  The disk brake spindle is fatter on the the
inside than the drum brake spindle.  Since I loaned one of my
drum brake spindles to a friend, I opted to use the disk brake
spindles.  I applied RTV between the spindle and knuckle so they
don't rust together.  If I had anti-seize at the time, I would
have used that.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Install Brake Hub: </strong>
The '72 CJ-5 used a brake hub for a six bolt lock-out with
Warn Premium hubs on it.  The '81 CJ-5
used a brake hub for a five bolt lock-out with cheap factory
hubs.  I wanted to use the old brake hub, this meant I had to
swap over the rotor and switch bearings.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The first step in removing the rotor is removing the studs.
Put an old lug nut on the lugs and hammer on it until
the lug pops out.  After all the lugs are removed, the rotor
should fall free of the brake hub.  The disk brake axle uses
a slightly different lug with a long shoulder to go through
the rotor.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The reason I had to switch bearings is because I had installed the
spindles from the disk brake Dana 30.  The disk brake Dana 30
uses a spindle that is fatter on the inside and the same diameter
on the outside.</p>

My bearings
were in good shape, so I just removed them from the disk brake
hub, repacked them, and installed them in the drum brake hub.  The
bearings can be driven out and installed with a screw driver and
hammer.  There is a channel on the side that should be used to
do this so you don't damage the bearing or race.  Removing the
inner bearing seal almost always destroys it, so I installed new
inner bearing seals all around.</p>

</table>
<p class="bodytext">
After the bearings and races were installed, I put the rotor on
the older brake hub and set the disk brake lugs in place with
a hammer to hold the rotor in place.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Once the rotor and bearings are in place, installing the brake
hub is a matter of sliding it over the spindle installing the
inner washer, inner nut, and torquing to spec.  After the
inner nut is installed the locking washer and outer nut are
installed, torqued, and the washer is bent over with a screw
driver or the like.</p>

<p class="bodytext">
<strong>Install Hub/Lock-out: </strong>
Installing the hub/lock-out is a piece of cake, especially with snap
ring pliers.  With the Warn Premium hubs, slide the hub body over
the shaft and put the snap ring on the end o the shaft.  Sometimes,
prying the shaft behind the knuckle will help get the shaft in place
to get the snap ring on.  After the snap ring is seated, bolt on
the outer piece of the hub/lock-out.  After the hubs/lock-outs are
installed, you should be done.</p>

If you are considering a disk brake upgrade for your 70s CJ with
drum brake, I've heard from a few people that the stock master
cylinder and proportioning valve work with out modification.
I've never tried it myself, but a few people have said it works.
I'm planning on using a master cylinder and and swing arm pedal
from a '77 CJ-7 with disk brakes and a proportioning valve from
a '73 Scout II, but that will come later.  I've selected
these parts only because I happen to have them.  I need to repair
the tub before I can plumb the brakes up.
