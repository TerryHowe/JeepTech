Anyone will tell you that the key to a good paint job is the prep work.
Body work on a Jeep is something you need to strike a delicate balance
between looking good and not wasting a lot of time.  I wasn't building
this Jeep to be a show truck and I knew I'd be scratching and denting
the body before too long anyway.  I probably ended up spending too
much time on the prep work. It is hard not to get carried away, but
the results were excellent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
This Jeep was a real challenge to paint because every piece of metal was
bent or rusted through, but it is only a Jeep.  Jeeps have relatively
little metal body to begin with, there's no roof!  Jeeps also have
mostly flat panels and simple curves.</p>

<p class="bodytext">
I'd spent the past four years driving a beater and for the most part
it is a lot of fun.  I could wheel with reckless abandon, but I was
getting tired of having such an ugly Jeep.  The plan with this Jeep
was to make it good looking, but easy to repair.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
A solution to the maintainability was to chose a color I could easy
get touch up paint for.  In the past, I'd picked odd-ball colors that
I liked, but I couldn't touch up scratches because I couldn't find
any touch up paint that was close.  I'd also gone the rattle can
path in the past and I wasn't happy with the color selection, price,
or the durability of the finish.  I decided to chose a color from
a new model so I could easily get touch up paint, the color I chose
was the new Jeep Chili Pepper Pearl Metalic.  I loved the color the first
time I saw a TJ painted this color.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
From past experience, I knew I wasn't the neatest painter in the
world.  I tend to lay it on too heavy which causes sagging, etc.
I enrolled the help of Roger Wild, a friend of mine who has done
a lot of painting in the past.  Since Roger was going to shoot it,
I asked him to choose the type of paint and he chose Dupont Centari.
<p class="bodytext">
The Dupont Centari is a bit of an old school paint, it is a one
step process, not like newer paints where you shoot color and then
clear coat.  A good paint just the same and not cheap.  Since the
flat fender had such a small body and I was only planning on shooting
the exterior, I only had two quarts mixed up.  The paint with a
hardener and some reducer ran me over $140.  The primer was extra.</p>

I wasn't going to shoot the interior since I had already Durabaked
the inside and the underside I had already rattle canned black.  I
rattle canned the underside black to make it more maintainable if I
decide to go with a different color in the future.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Painting the Jeep was an all weekend project working a lot of hours.
I had some last minute Bondoing, sanding, and masking to do before
shooting primer.  We also had to set up my garage to shoot the primer
in the winter time.  I had to provide ventilation and heat to keep the
temperature within specification for the primer.</p>

<p class="headline">Wet Sanding</p>
<p class="bodytext">
After the primer was shot and allowed to dry for a while, it was time
to begin the wet sanding.  Wet sanding is crucial to providing a
smooth finish that will shine.  I wanted a shine, but not a show
car shine, so I only used 400 grit for the wet sanding.</p>

<p class="headline">Shooting Color</p>
<p class="bodytext">
When the wet sanding was complete, we loaded up the tub and other
body parts on my pickup truck and brought them over to a paint booth
I had rented for the final coat.  The paint booth was completely
ventilated and clean for shooting the final coat to reduce the
chance of dust settling on the wet paint.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
We set up all the body parts in the paint booth and I was light
boy while Roger shot color.  The paint booth did have lighting,
but not enough for Roger's tastes, so I followed him around with
a halogen flood lamp.  It was amazing to see the color after
months and months of body work.  The finish was outstanding and
the color rich.</p>
