You may have noticed in the pictures taken when the tub was
being Durabaked that the corners were completely cut out of the body.
Both corners were badly damaged by the previous owner from
accidents and cutting with a torch.  Rust had also taken some
chunks out of the corners.  Rather than try to fix the corners, I
decided to just cut them out and replace them with some heavy
duty corner protection from Off-Your Rockers.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I had Off-Your Rocker rocker guards on my CJ-7 and just loved
they way the worked, so I asked Off-Your Rockers to make me
some of their corner guards.  Dan did not have a pattern for a
CJ-2A, but I was able to compare it to my CJ-7 and determine
that the curve was the same.  I asked him to send them out to
me without cutting out the wheel well since I wasn't sure
what that curve would look like.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Dan said he would be more than happy to make any cuts I needed
in the corners if I just marked them out and mailed the corners
back to him.  I was able to save some shipping costs by asking
a friends with a plasma cutter to make the cuts for me.  I had
my friends over at Rock Ware cut out the wheel wheel opening
for me and cut out holes for tail lights and backup lights.  I
saved the corner material I cut out of the tub to mark out the
wheel well opening and I used a coffee can to mark out for the
lights.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
After the corners were cut out, it was just a matter of drilling
them and the tub for mounting.  Off-Your Rockers sent with the
corners a bunch of stainless steel, button head, hex bolts to attach
them to the tub.  In my case, the roll bar also bolted through the
corner guard so they were firmly tied in.</p>
