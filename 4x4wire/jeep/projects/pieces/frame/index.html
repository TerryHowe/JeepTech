The frame on Project Pieces and Parts is probably the most radical
work so far.  The original frame I got with this Willys was from
a '50 CJ-3A and it was badly bent and had numerous welds on it.
The rear section was rusted clear through in places.  I decided
there was no saving it, but kept it just in case.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I happened to stumble across a '73 Commando for next to nothing
that was missing the engine and suffered severe fire damage to the
interior.  I took it apart and sold some and saved some, the brakes
I used for the rear axle on Pieces and Parts.  The frame was
left over and it was in great shape and boxed almost all the way.
Obviously, it was too long for a flat fender, but after some measuring,
I determined I could use it if I took about 25" out of middle and
8" off the back.  I started cutting.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The back end was the easy part, I just cut off about 8" with a
circular hand saw.  The remaining rear part of the frame turned
out to be the same dimensions as the original frame.  The Commando
uses a spring that was shorter in the front than it is in the back,
so the resulting axle position ended being the same.  I left the
axle bump stop and shock mount where it was.  I bolted on the front
spring hanger from the original frame on the front and welded it
on as well.  Originally, it was riveted and welded on.  On the rear,
I used the cut down shackle hanger from a CJ-7 bolted on.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The Commando has the springs mounted outside of the frame rails,
and the shackle hanger was built into the rear cross member.  It
wasn't worth reusing the original crossmember, so I built my own
out of some 4x4x1/4" angle.  I happened to pick up a scrap of this
cheap at the scrap yard.  Since it was heavy gauge, I built a
combination cross member and rear bumper.  I cut the sides at angles
and welded a tab on the back to tie it into the same bolt that attaches
the shackle hanger to the frame.  Two 1/2" bolts attach it to the top
of the frame and two 1/2" bolts go through the bottom of the frame
and the shackle hanger.  I bolted a shackle hanger to the middle for
recovery.</p>

<p class="bodytext">
After the rear cross member was squared away, I was ready to chop
out the middle to get the proper length.  On the inside channel, I
was able to cut the channel where it tied into a cross member in
from of the axle.  This welded back together very clean and looks
stock.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The outside channel was cut further toward the middle so
that both joints wouldn't be in the same place and it was butt
welded together.  Once the body is ready to go on, I'll need to
weld back on all the body mounts that were cut off.  At this time
I'll weld on a plate over this cut.  Straight vertical welds on
frames are said to be prone to cracking, but a fish mouthed
plate welded over the cut will distribute the stress horizontally.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The front bumper is minimalist to the extreme.  I cut a piece from
the same 4"x4"x1/4" angle that I used to fabricate the rear bumper.
I cut it a 1/4" longer than the width of the front frame rails and
welded small caps over the end.  The top of the bumper is held on
by a bolt that goes through the winch mount, through the bumper,
and then through the frame.  The bottom bolt goes through the frame and
a small piece of 2"x2"x3/16" angle welded to the back of the bumper
just like I'd done on the rear bumper.  I managed to cut off an
additional 2" from the frame horns to improve the angle of approach.
In the middle of the bumper, with just enough clearance for a roller
fairlead, is a single shackle bracket.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The 25" cut out of the middle of the frame will not bring the frame
specifications for the flat fender, but this is intentional.  CJ-2As
have a wheel base of about 80" and this frame will have a wheel base
of about 83".  The crossmember/bumper will stick out about 2" in
the rear, but since it is both a crossmember and a bumper, it should
look normal.  The front axle is moved forward about 1".  This was
done to gain room for more rear driveshaft and great stability on
the trail.  An 83" wheelbase is about the same as the AMC version
of the CJ-5.  After the frame was all together and the springs
and axles were all bolted on, my buddy Sean came over and helped
me test fit the tub, hood, and grill on the frame to see how it
laid out.  As you can see from the pictures it looks pretty
natural.</p>
