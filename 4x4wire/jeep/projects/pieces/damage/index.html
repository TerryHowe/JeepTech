<p class="bodytext">
A complete disassembly of this flat fender revealed several
problems that were not immediately apparent.  The biggest problems
are with the tub and the frame.  It was quite obvious that
the engine was toast from the beginning.

<p class="bodytext">
The good news was the axles, transfer case, over drive, and
transmission all appeared to be in excellent shape.  Close
inspection of the axles, transfer case, and transmission all
revealed a build date in 1950.   The title I got with the
Jeep was for a '50 CJ-3A, so these were probably parts from
that Jeep.

<p class="headline">Axles</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The '50 CJ-3A used a Dana 25
front end and Dana 41 rear end.
The Dana 25 use small 9" drums and is a closed knuckle axle.  The Dana
41 is fairly stoat, but it uses 10 spline shafts of two piece design,
and it uses small 9" drums.  Since I wanted to use an open knuckle
Dana 30 or Dana 44 front end with disk brakes and a rear Dana 44
with one piece shafts, the axles were sold.

<br clear="all">
<p class="headline">Springs</p>
<p class="bodytext">
It looked like the front springs had been replaced at some time, but
the rears were probably original.  The leaves on the rear springs
were all rounded off from rust and an add-a-leaf suspension lift
had been installed.  The add-a-leaf style suspension lift doesn't
give too much lift and just tends to stiffen the ride.  One of the
newer front springs also suffered from a broken main leaf.  I ended
up just giving them away.

</table>
My neighbor Gary, who also is a flat fender enthusist, stopped by to
see how I was making out with my project.  He said that most likely,
the frame matches the 1950 CJ-3A as well since '2As used a narrower
channel frame.  He also pointed out this wicked bend along the
passenger side frame rail.  A large kink was visible just behind
the spring hanger.  Numerous sloppy welds were visible on the frame
horns and on the front cross member.</p>

  </tr>
</table>
The rear of the frame was
paper thin and a large rust hole could be seen right in front of
the rear spring hanger.  The rear cross member was  damaged from
sloppy use of a torch.  I can't figure out why the torch was run
along the edge of it.  It also looked like someone had wrapped a
chain around the rear cross member to extract someone.  It was bent
pretty badly from the pull.  Getting this frame back in shape, and
converting it to power steering, would be a lot of work.  I decided
it would be best to scrap it and find another frame.
</p>

<br clear="all">
<p class="headline">Transmission and Transfer Case</p>
The '50 CJ-3A also used a
Dana 18 transfer case and
T-90 three speed.  The T-90
had a Chevy adapter on it to mate with the Buick 231 that was installed
in the flat fender.  The transmission, transfer case, and overdrive
were all sold to finance purchases of other parts more to my liking.
The T-90 is a fairly light duty unit, not really strong enough or
geared low enough for rock crawling.
The transfer case is the small hole version with the 1 1/8"
intermediate shaft, I wanted to use the stronger big hole Dana 18
with 1 1/4" intermediate shaft.
Since the overdrive was 26 tooth and only for a small hole transfer
case, it too was sold.

The engine was pulled and set on the garage floor.  It will be

The tub of the Jeep has seen lots of body work over the years and
several coats of paint.  The original color appears to be "Harvest
Tan", some is still visible behind the dash and on the firewall.
Coats of yellow, black, blue, and red are visible as well as layers
of Bondo.  The rear floor had been entirely replaced with a piece of
galvanized sheet metal.  The drivers and passenger seat floors were
coverered with sheet metal.  The tool box door was welded shut for
some reason, maybe because the tool box no longer had a bottom to
it.</p>

Serial number plate and hole in fire wall
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
The fire wall had a big hole cut in it to make room for the
V6 and maybe to provide a little heat for the passengers, it was
not covered up.  The front fenders were chopped out, probably to
provide cooling for the V6 and the hood featured a hood scoop with
a Buick "Special" logo on it.  The grill was cut out to fit ugly
square lights rather than the original bullet style lights.  The
wind shield frame has an extreme rust problem with the top tube
and the sheet metal is rusted through.

  </tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
The entire body was attached to the frame with 5 bolts.  Two of
them were on the grill and three of them on the tub.  A three inch
wood block body lift was installed, a few of the blocks were split
or missing.</p>

<p>
Despite all the damage, I am going to try to save the tub, fenders,
hood, grill, and wind shield.  There will be a lot of sheet metal work
to do it, but locating a good tub inexpensively has proven to be
extremely difficult.
</p>

<p class="headline">Interior</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The two seats that were installed in the flat fender were mismatched
and badly damaged.  One was full of seeds and such and must have been
home or a mouse or other rodent at one time.  The seats were broken
down and dragged out to the trash pile.  Many gauges were stuffed
through the a custom built dash, some of them may be salvageable.
The original dash was so hacked up, an entirely new dash will need
to be built.
</p>

<p class="headline">Steering</p>
<p class="bodytext">
<table width="150" border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" class="notebox" align="right">
  <tr> 
    <td class="titlebar" align="center"><a href="/jeep/projects/pieces/damage/pieces_ross.jpg"><img border="0" src="pieces_ross_.jpg" width="145" alt="Stock Ross steering box, column, and linkage" height="80"></a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="caption">
Stock Ross steering box, column, and linkage
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
The steering column, Ross
steering box, and assorted linkage seemed to have a lot of slop
in them.  Actually, slop in the stock steering linkage is normal
since there are so many parts involved.  I gave the column, box,
and linkage to my neighbor Reg who has a couple military and other
assorted flat fender projects.  I'm hoping to go with Saginaw
power steering and a GM type tilt steering column.
</p>

<p class="headline">Brakes/Clutch</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The clutch used basically original linkage with the pedal through
the floor, but the brakes had suffered a frightening bit of fabrication.
The original frame mounted master cylinder was removed and replaced
with a fire wall mounted single reservoir master cylinder.  A swing
arm pedal was installed and the master cylinder was "held on" with
threaded rod.  The swing arm pedal may be retained, but the master
cylinder and mount will definitely have to be replaced.
</p>

<p class="headline">Tires</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I was lucky enough to give away the tires to the guy that bought
my transfer case.  The 10" chrome rims were too wide for my needs
and they were rusty.  A 12.5" wide tire seems to ride much better
on an 8" rim.  You get a good sidewall bulge and the tire almost
never blows a bead when wheeling.  The 35s were bigger than I wanted
to go and they were bald and rubber rotted.  I don't know how the
previous owner drove the thing with 35s and the small drums.  The
turning radius was terrible because the tires hit the frame rail
with about half a turn of the steering wheel.
</p>

<p class="headline">What's Next</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I ended up selling about everything I didn't want for about $750,
nearly twice what I paid for the Jeep.  All that and more will
probably go into buying parts more suitable to my needs.
