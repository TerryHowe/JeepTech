Once the metal work and Bondo was complete, I decided it was time to
apply the Durabak bed liner.  The reason I applied the Durabak before
painting was I figured it would be easier to touch up the Durabak than
the paint.  I also figured the Durabak would stick better to bare
metal rather than paint that hadn't had a chance to cure yet.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The reason I wanted to use the Durabak was obviously for it's skid
resistant and tough finish, but also because it would hide the work I'd
done to the tub and give a more finished look.  Doing body work on a Jeep
is fairly easy, but both sides of the work are often exposed.  I had a
number of patches welded into various body panels and it was looking
great on the outside, but not as great on the inside of the tub.</p>

A respirator and disposable clothing are a good idea

It is much more pleasant to apply the Durabak with the right protective gear.
Durabak is very sticky and if you get some on your skin, it will be several
days before you get it off.  Latex gloves and throw away clothes are an
excellent idea.  Respirators are also an excellent idea, especially if you
are working in a garage without much ventilation.</p>

My buddy Sean helped me apply the Durabak.  Sean is a professional painter,
so he is familiar with the best techniques for applying various types of
materials and he had already Durabaked the interior of his '76 Bronco.
The picture of on the right is of Sean mixing up the Durabak.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Before we actually applied the Durabak, I scuffed up all the smooth
surfaces with a 36 grit sand paper.  This took very little time since
most of my Jeep had been sand blasted.  After scuffing everything up,
I used a degreaser to clean up all the surfaces.  A few things, such as
screw heads, were masked out with tape so they could be removed in the
future.</p>

<p class="headline">Application</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Sean recommended using only brushes to apply the Durabak to give it the
smoothest possible finish.  The roller gives the Durabak a coarser finish.
In order to avoid brush lines a wavy motion was used with the brush.  The
material can be smoothed out even more if it is worked with the brush while
it is setting up.  Since it applied with a brush, it can really be worked
in where it might be hard to get a spray on bed liner.
<p class="bodytext">
We applied the Durabak to the inside of the tub, on the inside of tailgate,
under the front fenders, and under the rear fender wells.  In the fender wells,
it should help reduce road noise and protect them from rocks.  After the first
coat set up a bit, we applied a second coat.  The Durabak can be applied in
fairly heavy coats without sagging.  Two heavy coats were sufficient for my
tastes.</p>

<p class="headline">Conclusion</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The finish is excellent, it really covers up some of the uglies from the
tub repair.  When it is applied with a brush it is a bit more like the spay
on liners.  It is still non skid, but it is not super coarse.</p>
