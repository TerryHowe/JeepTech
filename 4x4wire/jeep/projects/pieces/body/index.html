The body work was by far the most complicated and time consuming part of this
project to date.  The tub was damaged beyond repair by most peoples standards,
but I decided to fix it mostly because it was original.  I wanted to maintain
a original look to the vehicle, but I did not duplicate factory techniques as
one would in a restoration.  The work was time consuming enough as it was.</p>

<p class="headline">Tub</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The body work started by completely replacing all the floor panels.  The
previous owner had already done this, but he cut out the old floor panels
out with a torch and did a sloppy job of brazing in pieces of galvanized steel.
I used some 16 gauge sheet metal on the floors which is thicker than original,
but easier to weld.  Since I didn't have a brake, I used some 1"x1" angle iron
to join the sheet metal in some places.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I used some 1"x3" square tubing to make body mounts on the bottom of the tub.
It was easy to drill this material out from the top with a hole saw and weld
in a captured nut.  After the nut was welded in, I welded the square tubing
to the bottom of the new floor.
<p class="bodytext">
After the floors were replaced and the body mounts welded on, I had the tub sand
blasted to remove all the old paint and Bondo.  The sand blasting exposed a lot
of problems, but it sure made welding easy.  A few patches were welded on the
sides and on the rear fender wells.  The passenger side needed a lot of
hammering since it had obviously been hit in some accident.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
There were a couple modifications I did to the tub since I was replacing a
lot of metal anyway.  One modification was to eliminate the tool box and add
a filler hole for an extra gas tank under the passenger seat.  The gas tank
under the drivers seat only holds around 11 gallons of fuel, so with two tanks,
I should have plenty of fuel for long drives.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Another modification I did was move the front of the rear fender back about
1".  This isn't much, but it doesn't take away from tire clearance and allows
the seats to be moved back an 1".  Flat fenders have very little leg room as
it is and every little bit helps.</p>

<p class="headline">Hood</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Sand blasting of hood made it look like swiss cheese.  The previous owner had
cut out a hood scoop with a torch and I just wasn't ambitious enough to fix
it.  I puchased a reproduction hood and had a friend, who is a professional
welder, weld in the stamped "Willys" emblems from the original hood.
It looked great and saved me hours of metal work.</p>

<p class="headline">Fenders</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Like everything else, front fenders were in rough shape.  They had been cut
out to allow outside the frame headers for the Buick engine.  The battery
box and inner fender was basically messed up beyond repair.  I decided to go
with completely open fenders to allow easy access to the engine, so I took
some 1" square tubing and reinforced they fenders.  With some small gussets,
the 1" tubing provided plenty of stiffness to the fender and they looked
great.

<p class="headline">Windshield</p>
<p class="bodytext">
After the windshield was sand blasted, it was clear that all of the horizontal
tubes would need to be replaced in order to save it.  Instead of going to all
the trouble, I bought a windshield from a '47 CJ-2A that was in fairly good
shape.  I had it sand blasted and did some minor repairs to it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I still didn't have a inner windshield frame that was in good shape, so I
decided to sacrifice the inner windshield and weld in a fixed one.  I had
heard it was common for the inner windshield to leak and I figured I'd find
water pooring in on my feet a bit annoying.</p>

<p class="headline">Grill</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Doing all the body work, I discovered that the tub, tailgate, windshield,
hood and one fender were original to the CJ-2A and one fender and the grill
were from another Jeep.  The grill had be cut up to accept some different
marker lights, but it looked like a CJ-3A grill.  I wanted to use the original
bullet style lights that were used on the early CJ-2As.  I patched up the
holes in the grill and cut a hole the correct dimensions for a CJ-2A.
I fabbed a mount for the bullet style parking light.</p>

<p class="headline">Conclusion</p>
<p class="bodytext">
After all the metal work, it was time to skim on a coat of Bondo to give the
Jeep a good consistent finish for painting.  The Bondo was thicker than I'd
like in areas, but many parts will be later protected with diamond plate.</p>
