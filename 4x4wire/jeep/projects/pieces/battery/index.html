It is always a challenge fitting things into a flat fender; fitting a dual
battery system into Project Pieces &amp; Parts was no exception.
The original location for the battery on CJ-2As is on the
passenger side fender.  This works fine with the 134 I4 "Go Devil" engine,
but it gets pretty tight with a V8 or V6 engine.  I also wanted to cut out the
fenders as much as possible to keep the engine cool, so I didn't want to mount
the battery or batteries on the fenders.  The military Willys' have
an extra battery under the cowl (behind the passenger side dash), but I wanted
to put a heater in this area.  I finally decided behind the rear axle would be
the best place for the batteries.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Obviously, if the batteries were going behind the rear axle, they would need
some protection.  I got out the tape measure and discovered a CJ-7 gas tank
skid plate would fit back there and, with some chopping, be level with the
bottom of the rear bumper.  This area is normally occupied by a brace for
a PTO output.  A lot of people will cut out the brace and install a 15 gallon
early 70s CJ gas tank in this spot.  I was going with two gas tanks under the
seats, so this space was free.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I started prepping the CJ-7 gas tank skid plate by hitting it with a wire brush
to remove the grime and rust.  I cut off the trailing edge and drilled holes
for my shackle bracket.  The trailing edge attaches flush with the rear bumper,
and is held on by the bolts of the shackle bracket.  On the leading edge, I used
a 2&quot;x2&quot;x1/8&quot; piece of angle iron.  I cut it to length and welded
it to the frame rails and drilled it out for the holes in the leading edge of
the CJ-7 gas tank skid plate.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I needed to hold the batteries in place, so I fabricated my own dual battery
tray.  I used some 1&quot;x1&quot;x1/8&quot; angle and cut four pieces just
large enough for the bottom of the two batteries.  To hold the batteries down,
I used a piece of 1&quot;x1/8&quot; C-channel and some 5/16&quot; threaded rod.
The C-channel goes across the top, and the threaded rod goes down to the angle
iron around the bottom.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Wait a minute!  How do you get to your batteries you ask?  Since I had to
replace the floor in the rear, I built a little trap door in the floor.  I
used a piano hinge on it and two little cabinet roller latches to hold it
closed.  For a handle, I used the little D-ring that used to be on the
tool box under the passenger seat.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
To get power up to the engine, I went to my local welding supply store and
had two long cables made up to run the power from the batteries up to the
firewall.  On the fire wall, I have a terminal stud and a battery disconnect
switch that I purchased from Wrangler Power Products.  I run the power for
the whole Jeep through the switch except for the winch.  The reason I didn't
run the winch through the switch is because it can exceed the specification
for the switch.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The Wrangler Power Products catalog had a chart for selecting wire gauge size
based on amperage and length of cable.  According to the chart and the
max pull from my winch, I needed 2/0 cable.  This cable seemed excessive
to me, but I went with it anyway.  I needed two 20 foot sections of cable
to go from the back to the firewall on the passenger side.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Since the cables were so long and they ran right along the frame rail, I
decided it would be best to provide some protection for them.  A piece of
regular electrical conduit was purchased at my local Home Despot to run
the cables through.  I used my tubing bender to bend the conduit so the
cables wouldn't enter and exit the conduit at sharp angles.  The conduit
should greatly reduce the risk of a short.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The terminals for the switch are on the engine side of the firewall and the
lever for the switch is on the passenger compartment side of the firewall.
Since the switch is up behind the dash, I also can use it to a kill switch
to turn off all power to the Jeep for security.</p>
