There are many ways that tubing out portions of your four wheeler can improve
it's off road performance.  It can improve departure and approach angles, allow
more engine cooling, protect the engine and radiator in case of roll over,
allow larger tires with no lift, and improve visibility.  Maybe the best
reason is it just looks cool.</p>

<p class="headline">Approach and Departure</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The early Ford Bronco is a great looking vehicles, but if you want to wheel
hard stuff, you quickly learn that the front end severely hurts approach angle.
A Jeep with bobbed bumper and flat fenders can easily get a tire on something
that an early Bronco cannot because the Bronco has a large bumper and grill
up front.  Sean Lazelle solved this problem by getting a tube front end built
for his Bronco by RockWare.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The Bronco purist will be offended, but if all you care about is driving over
big rocks this is the way to go.  The actual approach angle isn't improved
all that much by doing this to a Bronco, but effectively, the angle greatly
improved.  Often, you just need to get a tire on something from an angle to
get up it.  With no grill, it is easy to get a tire on the rocks before the
frame or body hits.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
When I tubed out the rear of my flat fender, there no change in the real
departure angle, but corners that used to rub, just aren't there to get
in the way.  I also don't get rocks jammed in the fenders wells any more.
The corners don't get bent up when I hang up on one.  The back of my Jeep was
never a big problem because I was running wide tires, but with no back, it
went from a little problem to no problem at all.  There aren't many cases,
but there are some obstacles and lines that I can take now, that I could
not take before.</p>

<p class="headline">Engine Cooling and Access</p>
<p class="bodytext">
One added benefit of tubing out the front is improved engine cooling.  If
you live in a dry area or wheel exclusively in dry areas, removing the inner
fender wells can greatly enhance the cooling of the engine.  Vapor locking
can be eliminated with easier air flow around the engine.  Sean used to have
vapor lock problems all the time on extremely hot days with his full front
clip.  With the tube front end, there are no more vapor lock problems, even
with the temperatures over 100.  If you wheel in wet areas, the water
and dirt on the engine might cause more problems than it is worth.
<p class="bodytext">
Another benefit of running open fenders is easy maintenance.  All the spark
plugs and accessories are easy to get to.  If there is a problem, it is easier
to spot it.  I don't have any fenders at all, so I don't have to lean over
anything to get to the engine compartment.  It does make it a bit more
confusing to find a spot to lay tools, but not a big deal.</p>


<p class="headline">Engine Roll Over Protection</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Yet another benefit of a tube front end is roll over protection.  The tubing
can be built stronger than stamped steel and protect the engine and radiator
during a roll over.  When I tubed out the front of my flat fender, I started
with a radiator roll bar, a piece of tube bent specifically to protect the
radiator.  I braced it to the fire wall with two pieces of 1" tubing and
welded it to the front frame rails.  The grill bolts to the radiator roll
bar and the roll bar has hood pins on it for the hood.  I completely removed
the fenders, so I needed the hood pins to hold down the hood.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I rolled hard out in Farmington shortly after tubing out the front end
and my radiator survived completely.  The hood and grill were dented pretty
badly in the roll, I think without the roll bar, my radiator would have been
forced into the engine fan.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
There are two schools on radiator roll bars, internal and external.  I went
with an internal radiator roll bar.  The down side to this approach is your
grill and hood can be damaged in a roll.  The up side is the front end looks
cleaner and more stock.  I wanted to keep the Jeep looking a bit stock and
I didn't want my headlights obstructed by a roll bar.  I also think a roll
bar that extends above the hood would be distracting and annoying to look
at.  If an external roll bar does not extend above the hood, it will not
provide much more protection than an internal roll bar.</p>

<p class="headline">Big Tire, Little Lift</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The primary reason for tubing out my flat fender was to fit bigger tires
with no lift.  I had been running a set of 35x15.5 Super Swamper TSL/SXs
for a couple years and I just loved the tires.  They were pretty worn
down though and I wasn't willing to spend all the cash on new tires to
get another set of 35s, I wanted 38s.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The 35s I was running rubbed pretty hard in the rear, so the only way
I was going to fit 38s in the rear would be with some radical suspension
changes.  I was real happy the way the suspension worked and was doubtful if
any suspension changes would improve my vehicles performance.  I was also
reluctant to take the time to change the suspension.  Slowly a plan formed
in my mind, with no back to the Jeep, I could fit as big a tire as I wanted
with no change in suspension.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
My front tires rarely rubbed, but I knew with 38s, they would rub.  Some
tube work in the front eliminated this problem as well.  Tire size up front
can grow nearly infinitely.  Nearly the same is true of the rear.</p>

<p class="headline">Visibility</p>
<p class="bodytext">
By cutting the back off my Jeep and removing the fenders, I greatly improved
the visibility.  I can see exactly where both rear tires are.  I can also lean
over to the passenger side and get a good view of the passenger front tire.  All
this visibility doesn't help much when you drive though water and mud, but it
sure is nice the rest of the time.</p>

<p class="headline">Legal Issues</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Another big consideration is how far can you go and still have a street legal
vehicle.  Open wheel vehicles aren't legal in many areas, I've built my vehicle
for the trail only.  The way Jay Kopycinski's built his tube bed Toyota, he
probably has a vehicle that is legal to drive in more areas.  He still has
fender wells and the added benefit of lots of cargo space.</p>

<p class="headline">Conclusion</p>
<p class="bodytext">
For me, tubing out my flat fender solved all sorts of problems.  I protected
the radiator and I was able to fit 38s with no lift.  For Sean, he greatly
improved his engine cooling and improved hs approach angle.  Another added
benefit that may be gained is lightness.  In my case, I probably removed
100 pounds from my vehicle with all the sheet metal I removed.
