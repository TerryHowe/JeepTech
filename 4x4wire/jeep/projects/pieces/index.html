<p class="bodytext">Project Pieces &amp; Parts has been a long and
changing project.  When the project began, I wanted to make a nice
streetable CJ-2A that would perform well on the trail, but near the
end I wanted to build a hard core rock crawler.  The change in direction
created some changes in the project in the middle of the project.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The reason for the change in direction was the slow death my '81 CJ-7.
I'd been wheeling my CJ-7 harder and harder over the past eight years
and the damage was very hard to keep up with.  I finally decided
it would be easier to scrap the CJ-7 and focus on the CJ-2A.  With my energy
focused on the CJ-2A, I knew I could make it a great rock crawler.</p>

If your Jeep has half ton internal hubs, chances are you have the three piece
spindle nuts. The inner nut sets the tension on the bearing, the lock washer
slides down the slot on the spindle and a pin on the inner nut goes in a hole
in the lock washer, and the outer nut holds it all in place. Sometimes, you
get lucky and that lock washer slides right down and the pin in the nut goes
right in a hole in the lock washer, sometimes it doesn't. Some Ford Dana 44s
use a self locking spindle nut that does not require aligning the pin and
makes installation much easier.
