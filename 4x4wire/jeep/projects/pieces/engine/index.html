When I bought my CJ-2A, it had a odd fire Buick 225 in it of
unknown vintage.  The previous owner said there was a problem
with the engine and that is why it was torn down.  It was also
filled with water, so it didn't look like a good candidate for
rebuild.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The Buick V6 engines are excellent engines for a flat fenders and
CJ-5s because they are very short and the shorter the drive
train, the more drive shaft you get.  Drive shaft is in short
supply with short Jeeps.  Because of this, I decided to stick
with a Buick V6.</p>

I ended up purchasing a used even fire Buick 231 V6 for $220.
I was told it was out of a '79 Oldsmobile, but I found out
later it was actually a '80 engine.  The even fire is supposed
to idle better and it was convenient to get all the brackets
and accessories I wanted on the engine.  It had a regular
Delco alternator, "ham box" Saginaw power steering pump,
and rotary AC compressor all ready to go.</p>

In order to mount the 231 on the frame, I got the Buick
engine mounts from Advanced Adapters.  These engine mounts
are elegant and simple in design.  They provide plenty of
clearance for steering linkage which is a big concern with
flat fenders.  There is a bolt running through the mount
that is dampened with a rubber bushing, so you do not have to
worry about the mount separating.  They also give the
installation a real clean look.</p>

The biggest issue doing an engine and/or transmission swap with
a flat fender is drive shaft length.  You need to leave as much
drive shaft as possible to get a reasonable driveshaft angle.
You have to leave at least enough for a CV joint and slip joint.
The Buick V6 is of course very short because of the cylinder
layout.  With 3 cylinders on either side, it is shorter than
most I4 engines.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Since I was planning on using an automatic transmission, length
was even more of an issue since most automatic transmissions
are significantly longer than manual transmissions.  The picture
above on the right shows the Advanced Adapters engine mounts bolted
in place.</p>

<p class="bodytext">
The engine I bought had a large clutch type fan.  It was a
nice fan, but it added substantially to the over all length
of the engine.  I wanted to used a rigid fan with as large
a diameter as possible because cooling automatic transmission
can be a real challenge in a four wheeler.  Crawling in rocks
tends to cause automatic transmissions to heat up.  I wanted
a rigid fan because I've heard too many horror stories about
flex fans pulling into and eating radiators when they hit
water.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
A buddy of mine gave me a 18", high pitch, fixed, rigid fan.
It a appears to be a low end Flex-i-Lite rigid fan.  This fan
had the potential to save me 3.5&quot; over the original fan
on the engine.  My after-market fan would not clear the
clutch on the AC compressor, so I had to remove the AC compressor.
The York compressor clutch does not stick out the same way, so
someday I'll get a York compressor on the engine for on-board
air.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The fan should get me going at least.  I may go with a higher
pitch and larger diameter fan in the future.  I also need to
dig up a fan shroud.</p>

<p class="headline">Radiator</p>
<table width="100" border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" class="notebox" align="right">

    <td class="titlebar" align="center"><a href="/jeep/projects/pieces/engine/pieces_engine6.jpg"><img border="0" src="pieces_engine6_.jpg" width="100" alt="'67 CJ-5 radiator" height="94"></a></td>

<p class="bodytext">
The radiator that came with my flat fender appeared to be in
excellent shape.  I dropped it off at a local radiator shop
to have a tank installed for the automatic transmission.  It
turned out it was full of holes and basically messed up beyond
repair.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I stopped my Tom Hackle's shop, a local CJ used parts specialist,
and since he owed me some favors, he sold me a real nice radiator
for $30.  The radiator was from a late 60s CJ-5 with Buick V6,
so the hose location and size would work well for me.  The down
side was the bottom of it was too small  for an transmission cooler
tank.  The return on this radiator was right in the middle of the
radiator, so I had a radiator shop move the return over to the drivers
side corner.   This should improve cooling since the coolant will
have to flow all the way across the radiator and it will allow me
to use a larger fan.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The next step was fabricating a bracket to mount the radiator to
my grill.  I spaced the radiator 2&quot; from the face of the grill
which gave me enough room to fit two 3/4&quot;x7.5&quot;x15.5&quot;
transmission coolers in front of the radiator.  These coolers are
run in series and hopefully they will be sufficient.</p>
<p class="bodytext">

<p class="headline">Engine Mounts</p>
<p class="bodytext">
After cleaning the engine off at my local car wash, I bolted on
the Advanced Adapters engine mounts.  I had to grind a little
bit of material off the mount to clear the fuel pump.  With
<table width="100" border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" class="notebox" align="right">
  <tr> 
    <td class="titlebar" align="center"><a href="/jeep/projects/pieces/engine/pieces_engine4.jpg"><img border="0" src="pieces_engine4_.jpg" width="100" alt="A/A engine mounts" height="81"></a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td class="caption">

  </tr>
</table>
the grill bolted in place with the radiator on it, I was able
to determine where the engine could go.  The idea was to move
it as far forward as possible giving at least 1&quot; clearance
with the radiator.  I also needed to make sure the front drive
shaft or axle did not hit the oil pan.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
When I had the location figured out, I simply drilled holes in
the frame and bolted on the mounts.  I may weld the mounts on
the frame at a later date when I am sure I happy with the location
of the engine.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Another feature of the Advanced Adapters engine mounts is they
allow movement of the engine left and right.  Four holes are drilled
out on each engine side of the mount and the engine can be shifted
to the passenger side or drivers side.  This allow you to easily
adjust for clearance of drive shafts and steering linkage.</p>

<p class="headline">Plumbing and Wiring</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Once the engine and radiator were bolted in place, it was a simple
matter of plumbing and wiring everything.  I was able to bend one
of the original hose on the return and for the feed I used a generic
hose that was in the flat fender when I bought it.  The heater hoses
I ran the feed to the return for now.  I ran some fuel hose for supply
and return to a can of gas to get things started.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I did minimal wiring for now, just enough to get it fired up.  I
ran a wire to the distributor and to the alternator.  The big cap
distributor that came with my engine is not computer controlled.
The coil, cap, rotor, and advance are all in the distributor, so
it has only one wire that is hot when the key is in the run position.
The alternator has a sensor and output wire that run to the battery.</p>

<p class="headline">Fuel and Air</p>
<p class="bodytext">
When I bought my 231 it had a Rochester Dual Jet carb on top.
This carb has an unusual size top, but Dave Ewing was kind enough
<!-- Dave7986@aol.com Fram CA 327 -->
to give me a air filter housing off some vehicle with the same
carb.  The Housing fits great, nice and low down.  I should be
able to fit the hood on with no hole in it with a small body lift.
I didn't want to have a big hood scoop that would get in the way
of folding down the windshield.</p>

<p class="bodytext">
I'm going to stick with the Rochester Dual Jet carb for now, I'd
like to go with fuel injection of some sort some day.  The 231 is
available with multiport fuel injection, so this swap would be
fairly easy and and inexpensive.  Only down side is MPI is much
more complicated to trouble shoot compared with TBI.  For now,
the Dual Jet stays and a hose from the fuel pump to a little
can of gas feeds it.</p>

<p class="headline">Exhaust</p>
<p class="bodytext">
When I bought my CJ-2A, there was a set of Hooker headers in
the back for the 225.  These headers bolt right up to the Buick
231, so I decided to use them.  I just bolted glass packs to
the headers for now, but I'll put on some tubes to route the
exhaust to the side later on.</p>

<p class="headline">Firing It Up</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I changed the oil before I fired it up, but I didn't run new
plugs or wires.  I wanted to see how the thing would run before
I dropped any more money on it.  All I did to fire it up was run
a hot wire from the battery to the starter to trip the solenoid.
It cranked and it fired.</p>
