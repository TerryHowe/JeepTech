I wanted a roll cage that would maximize interior room and provide 
better than stock protection.  It is hard to do that with factory
cages and weld in kits, so I bent my own.
</p>
<!--#include virtual="/common/google_ads_jeep.stm"-->
<p class="headline">Materials</p>
<p class="bodytext">
For recreational wheeling, I felt that 1.75&quot;x0.120 wall DOM
tube would be best for protection and space.  The 2&quot; tube takes
a lot of room and the 1.5&quot; is kind of small unless you are going
to run a lot of cross braces.  I've seen and been in rollovers with
1.75&quot; tube and it has held up well, even with cages that are
pretty airy and not triangulated very well.  I probably could of run
a thinner wall tube for the dash bar and rear cross braces, but it
was easier just to use all 120 wall.  I definitely wanted the 120
wall for the main hoops and upper cross bars since 120 wall resists
denting a lot better than thinner tube.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Other than the three sticks of DOM tube, I used two six inch pieces of 3/4&quot; 0.060
wall HREW for gussets behind the front seats.  I also used six
3&quot;x3&quot;x3/16&quot; pieces of flat stock for foot plates.
I cut them out of a length of 3&quot;x3/16&quot; flat.  I bought
twenty-four 3/8&quot;x1&quot; grade 5 bolts, some fender washers,
and stop nuts to bolt it down.
</p>
<p class="headline">Construction</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The first step in building this cage was the hardest, it was building
the main hoop.  Most factory cages are built making a hoop  from side
to side behind the front seats.  I wanted to run two hoops from front
to back to increase usable room in the passenger compartment.  I also
wanted to square off the back of the Jeep like later Wranglers to
provide more protection for passengers.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Using my JD2 bender with 1.75&quot;x6.5&quot; die, I started a 15
degree bend at 31&quot;.  At 40&quot;, I did another 75 degree bend
to complete the 90 degrees.  I did a third bend that ended up to be
about another 75 degree bend at 87&quot;.  The result is a little
squarer than I wanted in the back, but pretty darn close.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
After the two main hoops were bent, I cut and drilled the six foot
plates.  When the foot plates were made, I took four of them and
welded them to the bottom of the main hoops.  The foot plates allowed
me to drill and bolt in the two main hoops.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
With the main hoops bolted in, I was able to measure for the three
cross members and the dash bar.  I cut all of these the same length
and fish mouthed the ends with my fish mouth jig.  I also made the
main upright bars that go behind the front seats.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
After all the new crossbars were deburred and cleaned up, I tack welded
them all in place.  I welded the two foot plates to the upright bars
and tacked them in place as well.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Before pulling the cage, I made two more bars to run from the top of
the upright bar to the bottom of the rear of the main hoops.  This
triangulates the cage front to back.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
It would be much stronger to triangulate the cage in the other direction
as well, but that is a compromise in space and convenience.  I wanted
some extra strength in that direction, so I used some 6&quot; long sections
of 3/4&quot;x0.060&quot; HREW to make gussets in the other direction.
These little gussets add a lot of strength and they are convenient to
loop a strap through.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I also drilled some holes and welded in tube on the main upright bars
so that I could run a three point seat belt in the future.  Right now I only
have lap belts, but I would like to run the three point belts in the
future.  I used the 3/4&quot; HREW for sleeve the seat belt bolt hole.
It would be been nicer to use a thicker tube to sleeve the bolt hole, but
that is all I had.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
After it was all tacked together, I pulled the cage and welded it out.
When the welds cooled, I wire wheeled it and cleaned it up.  Rattle
can black finished it up.  I like painting cages black because they
are easy to touch up.  It seems cages always get scratched.
</p>
<p class="headline">Conclusion</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The cage is very roomy and way safer than the factory cage my Jeep
came with.  From all my measurements, I'll have no problem fitting
a soft-top under the cage, but moving the bows up and down might
prove a little difficult.  I'll find out when I get a top for the
Jeep, until it gets cold, I'm just going to run a bikini top.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
One really cool thing about this cage design is my visors work!  I've
never had a Jeep with a six point cage and working visors.  I hadn't
bothered installing the visors before, in fact I'd welded up the holes
for them before I painted the windshield.  I just needed to move them in one
hole and drill new holes to fit them.  The front crossbar is back a good
6&quot; from the windshield which gives the visors room to move up and
down.
