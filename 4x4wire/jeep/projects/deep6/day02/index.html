it, I rebuilt a larger tunnel cover.

Since the outside and most of the inside of the tub was cleaned up, I
had the underside of the tub left to do.  I hadn't been looking forward
to this because of all the dirt under the tub and the general ugliness.
I managed to get my neighbor and his friend over at lunch time to help
me drop the tub to the floor.  They were home having a liquid lunch.</p>

<p class="bodytext">
Once the tub was on the floor, I hit it hard with the wire wheel.  Dirt
and filth were flying everywhere.  After hitting everything underneath
with the wire wheel, I welded up some small holes in the tub.  After
things were welded up, I sprayed the rusty parts with Extend rust converter.
<p class="bodytext">
I also ran out to Rock Mountain Memorial and dropped my hood off for
sand blasting.  They promised a one day turn around on it which is
great.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I also wire wheeled the battery tray.  I wasn't planning on using it
originally, but for some reason, I sold my dual battery tray on Ebay
a couple weeks back.  I sprayed it with the rust converter as well.
