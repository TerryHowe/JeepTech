I spent most of the day at the insurance auction today trying unsuccessfully
to purchase a slide in camper that had the top ripped off.  It sold for more
than I was prepared to spend.  Got some work done on the Jeep at night anyway.
The grill and wind shield are wire wheeled down which completes all the major
wire wheeling at last!  I sprayed both of them with the rust converter.

I bolted on the fenders which I'd cleaned up and done some major trimming
to earlier.  I need to get the hood mounted up since I'd like the hinges
mounted properly before spraying.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
To do something different, I broke out the Bondo and put a little on the
drivers side of the rig.  I have a couple patches that need to be smoothed
out there.
