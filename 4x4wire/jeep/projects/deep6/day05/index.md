A little Bondo on the tub and the fender mounted up. The fender had a lot of trimming done to it.

The grill has been wire wheeled down to bare metal.

The wind shield was partially cleaned up.

I spent most of the day at the insurance auction today trying unsuccessfully to purchase a slide in camper that had the top ripped off. It sold for more than I was prepared to spend. Got some work done on the Jeep at night anyway. The grill and wind shield are wire wheeled down which completes all the major wire wheeling at last! I sprayed both of them with the rust converter.

I bolted on the fenders which I'd cleaned up and done some major trimming to earlier. I need to get the hood mounted up since I'd like the hinges mounted properly before spraying.

To do something different, I broke out the Bondo and put a little on the drivers side of the rig. I have a couple patches that need to be smoothed out there.
