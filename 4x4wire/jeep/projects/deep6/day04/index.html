I wasn't particularlly in the mood to work on the old Jeep today, but
I got some things done anyway.  I painted the firewall black for one
thing.  After that was dry, I managed to get my friend Sean over for
a bit and one of my neighbors to help me put the tub back on the
frame.

<p class="bodytext">
I went out and bought a lot of supplies for the project ot avoid
work.  I got a gallon of Herculiner and some more rust converter.
I wire wheeled the inside of the tub and sprayed on the rust
converter so I can put on the Herculiner in a couple days.

<p class="bodytext">
I cleaned up the wind shield and removed the broken glass.  I wire
wheeled some of it, but it needs more.  It also needs some welding
and some rust converter.
