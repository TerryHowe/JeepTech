While I was away for the weekend wheeling in Moab, the engine wiring
harness came in.  As soon as I got back, I was setting it up.  The engine
needed to be wired for the gauges and the fuel injection.  I had to splice
in the original CJ harness with the new engine harness.
</p>
<!--#include virtual="/common/google_ads_jeep.stm"-->
<p class="bodytext">
I started wiring the engine by plugging in all the injectors, the TPS
(throtle position sensor), IAC (Idle air control), the air temperature
sensor,  coolant temperature sensor, MAP (manifold absolute pressure),
O2 sensor, and knock sensor.  I had to buy a new knock sensor and MAP
sensor for a '91 Firebird with 350 engine.  All the other sensors and
parts I was able to use from the '89 engine.  That is pretty much it
for the engine.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I pulled apart the old engine wiring
harness and plugged in the oil pressure sending unit and temperature
sending unit.  I used the original sending units from the 232 engine
so they would work with my gauges.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I had Centech send me out a wiring kit for the alternator that I wired
up to the battery and to the hot on run and start wire.  I also ran the
starter wire.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Lots of zip ties and wire loom where used to protect and secure everything.
Compared with the original Fireturd MAF (mass air flow) wiring harness, the
speed density harness is extremely simple and neat.
