Rather than spend all day in the garage, I decided to make some
calls and get my engine wiring straightened out.  I had the original
wiring harness from the '89 Firebird, but there were a couple problems
with it.  The Fireturd harness was slightly damaged from a leaky exhaust
and it was a MAF (mass air flow) engine and I didn't really have room
to run the MAF sensor.  I wanted to run a speed density engine with the
MAP (manifold absolute pressure).  The MAP engine is just a neater
package, you can just slap a cone filter on the air intake.

On my flat fender, I had a '77 CJ-7 wiring harness and I spliced that
in with a '90 S-10 harness for a 4.3L engine.  I did not enjoy the
experience and had some minor problems with the wiring when I was
done.  I wanted to avoid those problems and get the wiring done right
the first time.

I've always had luck with Howell, so I gave them a call and they quoted
me $950 for a complete kit to swap the engine from MAF to MAP.  Probably
a fair price, I've always had luck with them in the past, but more than
I wanted to spend.

I gave Centech a call and they said if I ran out to the junk yard and
found a computer with the service number 1227730 I could rechip it and
use one of their wiring harnesses.  Their harness would cost me just
under $400 and the chip #16151348 would cost around $85 from the Chevy
dealership.  I would also need to buy a knock sensor, a MAP sensor, and
a cone filter for a '90-'91 350.  The computers go for $15 a piece at my
local u-pull-it, so I save a couple hundred.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
It was a little after 2pm MDT and Centech is on EDT and I wanted to
get the computer and order the harness by the end of the day.  I got
to the junk yard and started pulling computers like a mad man looking for
the right one.  I must of pulled 20 of them before I got one out of an
'87 Cavalier.  Five minutes later, I pulled a spare computer out of a
'86 Cavalier, but it was 3:20 when I left the junk yard and close
to 4 when I got home, so I wasn't able to order up the harness.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I spent the rest of the day removing everything from the dash and getting
it ready for paint.  I also did some prep on the fresh air vent and the
wiper motor cover.
