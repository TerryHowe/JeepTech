I spent most of Monday catching up on all the things I was supposed to be
doing while I was working on painting the rig.  I only clocked about two
hours on the rig today, but I got a couple things done.
<p class="bodytext">
One thing I managed to do was get the transfer case linkage hooked up.
When I bought the transmission and transfer case from a '91 Suburban a
couple years ago, I also took the transfer case linkage from the donor.
It was a nice shifter and I was able to work it into my new tunnel cover.
I had to slightly lengthen the rod from the shifter to the transfer case,
but the end result is slick.  I have a Lokar shifter on the 700R4.

<p class="bodytext">
The other thing I managed to get done was bolt in the battery tray.  I still
need to fix the battery mount, but I'd like to get the battery hooked up
as soon as possible so I can wire the Jeep up and test the results.
