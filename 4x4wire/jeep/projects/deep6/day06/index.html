The morning was spent working on the windshield.  The top of it was rusted
pretty bad between the metal.  Earlier, I'd cleaned out as much as possible
and sprayed it with rust converter.  To prevent future problems, I welded
it all up today.  After grinding, a little Bondo will smooth it all out.

There were a couple minor things I needed to do to the tub before brushing
in the bed liner.  I cut an access hole for the fuel sending unit so I can
get to that easily.  I made a cover plate for the clutch linkage hole since
I installed an 700R4.  I also made a bracket for the parking brake since
the old one wouldn't work.  The bedliner should go in as soon as the Bondo
is done.

The hood was mounted and I adjusted the mounting of the windshield.  Earlier,
I'd painted under the hinges black so there wouldn't be bare metal under
the hinges.

Nearly a quart of Bondo has been used to smooth things out.  It will be
wavey, but smooth.  Bondo dust covers the floor and everything including
myself.  I've been mixing up small, hot batches and I had to go to the
auto parts store covered in dust to get more hardener.
