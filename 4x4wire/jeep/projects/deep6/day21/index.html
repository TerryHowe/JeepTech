With the fuel tank done, I finally filled the tank with some gas and sarched
for fuel leaks.  After trying to get the engine fired up for a while, I
finally realized the fuel pump was not putting out enough pressure and so I
swapped it out.  The timing was all messed up, but I finally got the engine 
fired up, running, but running very poorly.

With the engine running, I put the Jeep on the trailer and took it to the
exhaust shop.  I had them put on a pretty quiet muffler so I can come home late
without bothering the neighbors.  With the muffler on, I can work on
the engine timing and think at the same time!

The license plates were kind of hard to find places for.  I wanted to
place them so they would not get damaged.  On the tailgate, I put
the rear plate under some of the footman loops.  I think only the
early CJs have the footman loops, but even in '75 the tailgate was
stamped for them.  On the front, the license plate was a little hard
to locate because of the weird winch mount I had.

The other little task I took care of was installing the RC5000 K&N; filter.
It is a cool little tapered cone filter that goes on the front of the 
speed/density TPI 350.  Looks good on there.

<p class="bodytext">
The tasks left to do, other than getting the engine dialed in, include
a top, roll cage, and some rocker gaurds.  Those projects will probably
have to wait a while.
