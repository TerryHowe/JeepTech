I spent most of the morning and afternoon doing some more Bondo work and
lots and lots of sanding.  I also ran out to the paint store and looked
at colors and picked up some etching primer and regular primer.  The regular
primer allows some build up and will cover small scratches.  The etching
primer is for bare metal which I have a fair amount of.  It is very close
to being ready to spray the primer, but my buddy with the HVLP is busy
working and not able to get out at night.  Paint will probably happen this
weekend.

Around 7pm, my wife Diane came out to help me.  I sanded down the inside
of the tub with 60 grit while she swept up the floor.  Next, I cleaned
the inside of the tub out with laquer thinner after she had vacuumed it. 
Web both broke out the brushes and started laying on a heavy coat of 
Herculiner on the inside of the tub and the rear fender wells.  It turned
out great.  Two or three quarts probably would of done the job, but I layed it
on heavy in spots and used up a whole gallon.  It looks great!

Herculiner is the same as Durabak, it is the retail version of the product.
I've used Durabak on a number of projects, including my flat fender and
my '75 J-10 pickup.
