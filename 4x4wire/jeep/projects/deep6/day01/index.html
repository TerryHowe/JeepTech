The badk of the Jeep.  Both rear quarters were smashed up pretty bad and rusted,
so I cut out the old material and welded in some 3/16" diamond plate corners.

From the side, you can see I've been busy with the wire wheel..  All day busy.
I was going to get it sand blasted, but I have a lot of time and little
money right now.

Yet again, I've been working for a start up company that ran out of money.
This puts me on unemployment and with lots of spare time when I'm not 
looking for work.  It seemed like a good idea to do some work on the old
CJ-6.</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I spent all day wire wheeling the outside of the tub.  My wife was helping
me the other day and wire wheeled a good portion of the cowl.  I've taken
it down to bare metal pretty much everywhere on the outside.  It needs some
Bondo over the several patches I welded in and it needs to be hit with some
220 before I prime it.</p>

<p class="bodytext">
I also wire wheeled the rear fender wells on the inside of the tub.  One
of the previous owners decided to glue down some fabric with lots and lots
of some sort of paste type glue.  What a mess.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The tub was moved forward on the frame a little
to allow for larger tires and the big wheel wheel.  Under the dash is painted
silver for visibility.  It is sporting some 38" swampers now, but I'd like
to get a set of radials on there for driving around town.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Anyway, after twelve hours of wire wheeling, my arms are pretty tired, but
there is a lot more wire wheeling to do yet!
