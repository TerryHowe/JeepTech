The passenger side seat bracket bolted on the seat with some pieces of 3/16" flat stock to adapt the seat to the bracket. The front lever for the catch is screwed to the seat.

If you want to upgrade seats on an early CJ, you would think the seats would bolt right to the brackets. The drivers side is easy, but the passenger side is difficult.

My drivers side seat had a slider and the slider bolted to one set of holes in the Bestop seats I bought. Installing the drivers side seat could not be easier, but I still wanted to modify the bracket a little.

Even though they'd moved the gas tank under the tub by 1975, the seat bracket was still designed to clear a fuel tank under the drivers seat. I'd redone the tunnel cover and used up some of this space to move the transfer case up. I also wanted to have a nice Tuffy locking console in the future, so I didn't want the seat bracket in the way of that. Cutting and shortening the drivers side seat bracket and drilling a new hole for the seat bracket solved that problem. It will easily to fit an 8" wide console between the seats now.

The passenger side seat is a lot more difficult. The bolt pattern for the seat is not standard, so I had to weld some 3/16" flat stock on the seat bracket to bolt on the aftermarket seat.

The other problem with the passenger side seat is it is designed to fold forward so you can get access to the tool box, but the latch for it is part of the seat. I cut off the handle of the latch and welded the latch to the seat bracket. Instead of the eye bolt, I used a small u-bolt to get the hook for the latch closer to the floor. Two holes drilled in the seat allow the release lever to be mounted up out the front as it was on the stock seats.
