If you want to upgrade seats on an early CJ, you would think the seats
would bolt right to the brackets.  The drivers side is easy, but the
passenger side is difficult.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
My drivers side seat had a slider and the slider bolted to one set of
holes in the Bestop seats I bought.  Installing the drivers side seat
could not be easier, but I still wanted to modify the bracket a little.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Even though they'd moved the gas tank under the tub by 1975, the seat
bracket was still designed to clear a fuel tank under the drivers seat.
I'd redone the tunnel cover and used up some of this space to move the
transfer case up.  I also wanted to have a nice Tuffy locking console
in the future, so I didn't want the seat bracket in the way of that.
Cutting and shortening the drivers side seat bracket and drilling a
new hole for the seat bracket solved that problem.  It will easily
to fit an 8&quot; wide console between the seats now.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The passenger side seat is a lot more difficult.  The bolt pattern for the
seat is not standard, so I had to weld some 3/16" flat stock on the seat
bracket to bolt on the aftermarket seat.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The other problem with the passenger side seat is it is designed to fold
forward so you can get access to the tool box, but the latch for it is
part of the seat.  I cut off the handle of the latch and welded the latch
to the seat bracket.  Instead of the eye bolt, I used a small u-bolt to
get the hook for the latch closer to the floor.  Two holes drilled in the
seat allow the release lever to be mounted up out the  front as it was
on the stock seats.
