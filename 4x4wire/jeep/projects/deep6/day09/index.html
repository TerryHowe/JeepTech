Well, Saturday was supposed to be primer day, but it went better than that and
worse.  Sean was coming over at 10am and by the time he got over, I had almost
everything bagged off and ready for primer.  Since the rig was most down to
bare metal, I wanted to shoot a coat of etching primer.  I'd had problems with
paint on bare metal in the past and I wanted this job to come out nice.

Things were pretty set up, so we ran out to the paint store and picked up
the color.  I already had a gallon of clear coat from a previous paint job.
This color was one of the cheapest of the hot rod colors I've bought to date.
It was only $20 a quart, so I bought a whole gallon to have plenty of material
on hand.  Sean estimated the paint job to require 3 quarts.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
We got back from the paint store and shot the etching primer.  The etching
primer was  ready mixed and we got good coverage with only one quart.  The
etching primer needs 30 minutes to set and we shot the regular primer on top
which is a build primer for sanding.  A quart of that material did the job
as well.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I was planning on just priming and wet sanding this day, but I was done the
wet sanding by around 7pm, so Sean stopped by and shot a coat of color.  
Unfortunately, there was some lifting on the hood, the color was curling
up.  I'm not sure if it was a reaction with the etching primer up there
or something on a rag I used to wet sand it.  Most likely something on
the rag.  This killed our hopes to shoot color and clear and get the whole
thing done in one day.  It needed to be sanded out and recoated.  Either
way, we got a lot done.
