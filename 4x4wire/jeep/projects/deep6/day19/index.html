The other side of the engine wiring harness contains the plugs for the
computer, the ALDL (assembly line diagnostic link), check engine light,
neutral safety switch, and brake switch.  I already had the computer 
mounted, so I just need to plug that in, but I also had to swap out
the chip in the computer.  I bought the chip (PROM) #16151348 for
only $45 which was a great price.  I removed the cover from the computer,
pulled out the old Cavalier chip, and plugged in the V8 chip.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
I drilled holes in the firewall to mount the ALDL and the fuse panel for
the engine harness.  I hooked up the neutral safety switch to my Lokar
shifter on my 700R4.  I can't seem to find my brake lights switch, so
that will have to happen another day.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I bought a small red light for the check engine light and drilled a
hole in the dash to mount it.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The check engine light comes on and the relay for the fuel pump clicks
on for a couple seconds, so it appears everything is working.  I still
don't have fuel, so it isn't ready to fire up just yet.
