It is hard to find a 20 gallon fuel tank for an early CJ.  The frame rails
are close together, so you cannot use later gas tanks, you cannot even use
the later 15 gallon tanks.  The 15 gallon tank that came with my Jeep leaked,
so I needed to do something.  I decided to make my own tank and my advice
to anyone that comes to this same conclusion would be don't do it!
The reason I would advise against making your own fuel tank is it is hard
to make it leak proof, it is very time consuming, and it is potentially
dangerous.
</p>

<p class="bodytext">
Part of the reason my tank was hard to make leak proof was it was too big
to make out of one sheet of sheet metal and my original plan did not work
quite right.  I had extra seams that wouldn't be necessary on another tank.
When I first bent my tank, it turned out too big and didn't provide enough
clearance with the leaf springs.  I had to cut it down and create a seam
where I should of had a bend.  I used the "hillbilly" brake to bend the
metal.  I just clamped a piece of angle iron down where I wanted the bend
and pushed the metal by hand.  I finished off the bend by hitting it with
a rubber mallet.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I tested the tank, by pressurizing it with 20psi of air from my air compressor.
This could be potentially dangerous if the tank blows up, but I got lucky.
I put soapy water on the tank to find air holes, dried them off, depressurized
the tank, and welded them up.  It took me nearly all afternoon to find and 
stop them all up.  The welds are ugly, but it seems to hold.  There are no
leaks that I know of yet.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The other reason I would recommend against making your own tank is it is
time consuming.  I have this unit as one day, but I have a long 2 days at
least in this project, probably closer to 3 days.  Part of the reason
for that is my original plan had to be modified, but even then, setting
up the fuel pump, sending unit, baffles, fill hole, access hole, ... took
a lot of time.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The other reason I would recommend against building your own fuel tank is
it is potentially dangerous.  You need to run wires through the tank.  You
need at least a sending unit wire and maybe a wire for your fuel pump.  If
anything goes wrong, your fuel tank may blow up.  Comforting thought.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The end result is not pretty, but I think it will be functional.
Mathematically, the tank should hold 24 gallons or so.  From experience
with other aftermarket tanks, I expect to get 22 gallons or less of fuel
in it.  To calculate the number of gallons of gas I expect the tank to
hold, I just divided the volume by 231.  An easy number to remember if
you are familiar with the 231 Buick V6, the gallon engine.  My fuel tank
was 25&quot;x15&quot;x16&quot; and with a few gallons taken off for tapered
sections of the tank, I got 24 gallons.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I was able to use the extra space provided by a 2&quot; body
lift to move the tank up higher and the clearance isn't bad.  The tank
is built mostly from 14g cold rolled steel and it has a 14g skid plate
welded on the bottom.  It should take some abuse.
