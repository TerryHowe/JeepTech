This Jeep has been torn down for two years, so I spent most of the day sorting
through the boxes and trying to find things.  Luckly, I'd labeled many things,
but not everything.  Some of the &quot;obvious&quot; things are not so obvious
anymore.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
One of the first things I worked on was getting the heater housing installed
and the heater controls hooked up.  I still need to run heater hoses and wire
up the heater motor.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I hooked up the chains on the tailgate and put all the footman loops on it.
The tailgate is actually from my old CJ-2A, so it has footman loops on the
tailgate for some reason, maybe to hold down the original top.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I put the gasket on the bottom of the windshield and started to put the
wiper motor linkage back together.  I need to run out sometime and get
a new piece of glass.  The windshield had a crack in it when I bought it,
looked like someone punched it from the inside.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The grill is now mounted up and the headlights are in there.  The hood
hardware is all set up so I don't need a stick to hold it open anymore.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The glove box door is mounted up nicely on the dash, although when I
put a six point roll cage in, I probably won't be able to open it.  I
also screwed the data plate on the dash.  The data plate has the weight
of the vehicle, tire pressure, and information like that on it.
