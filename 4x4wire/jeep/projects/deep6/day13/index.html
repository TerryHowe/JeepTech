This old CJ-6 original came with manual brakes and drums all around.  Even
with a manual transmission, it was a lot of work  to drive around town with
those brakes.  Since I was putting in a automatic transmission and it had
to have some power brakes.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
I wasn't interested in spending money to install power brakes, but fortunately,
I had a lot of junk around.  A couple years back, I parted out a '90 S-10
and put the 4.3L V6 in a flat fender.  I still had the brake master
cylinder and booster from that truck.  The master cylinder had a brake 
anti-lock computer and solenoid attached to it as well as a proportioning
valve.  I took this stuff off since I already had a proportioning valve on
my Jeep and I doubted I could get the anti-lock mechanism to work for my
application.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The master cylinder was one of those plastic and aluminum GM master cylinders,
very light and it holds a lot of fluid.  It is easy to see the fluid level from
the outside which is another nice feature.  The booster was quite large, but
not too big, is is a little over 10&quot; in diameter.  The master cylinder and
booster where designed to go on a flat firewall too which helped.  I had
another booster and master cylinder from an '89 Firebird that was similar,
but designed to go on a firewall that was not perpendicular.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The installation was pretty straightforward.  I just drilled out the firewall
for the booster which has a 3.5&quot; square pattern.  I cut some 3/4" round
tube to make a spacer to hold the booster out 5/8&quot;.  The swing arm
pedal bracket also needed to be drilled for the upper two bolts of the booster.
I used some 3/8&quot; bolts through the original master cylinder holes and
bolted everything together.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
The rod from the booster had too small a hole from my swing arm bracket and
it was too long.  I cut the rod off my old master cylinder and cut
the rod down from the booster.  I had some 1/2&qot; round tube to sleeve the
two rods together and I welded them up.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
After running some brake lines, I cleaned up and bolted on a gas fillter
from a '77 CJ-7 I parted out years ago.  The filler was a nice round one
and fit on the side Wrangler TJ style.  I didn't have room for a filler
on the back with the lights and all.
