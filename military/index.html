<h2>History</h2>
<P>
The military is where the Jeep began and the lineage of the Jeep
can even be traced to military vehicles today.  The first production
military Jeep was the MB of World War II fame.  It's success in the
military is still part of the mystic of civilian Jeeps today.  There
have been various Jeeps used by the US and foreign militaries over
the years and even the lineage of the Hummer can be traced back to
the Jeep.  The Hummer is developed and produced by AM General which
split off from AMC shortly after AMC purchased Jeep from Kaiser in
the early 70s.

Pictures of probably one of the rarest Jeep models ever built,
the M170.  The M170 is a stretched M38A1 similar to a CJ-6 and
very few were ever built.
