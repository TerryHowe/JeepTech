# Jeep Tech: Steering

## Upgrades

[
Borgeson Steering Shaft For Jeep CJ's
](/steer/borgesoncj/):
Jeep CJs commonly need replacement steering parts, since even
the newest CJ is 13 years old. Borgeson offers a stronger
alternative to factory replacement parts. Installation is
suprisingly easy and removing free play in a worn shaft
translates to obvious improvements in steering precision.

[
John Nutters High Clearance Steering](http://www.outdoorwire.com/4x4/jeep/tech/steer/SOA/):
High clearance tie rod for spring over axle Jeeps.  Using a combination
of junk yard parts and fabrication, you can get the tie rod out of the
way.
