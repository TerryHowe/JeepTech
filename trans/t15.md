# Jeep Transmissions: T-15

The T-15 is a 3 speed transmission with a cast iron case.
I has a casting number of T15 or 1307 and a 1 1/8" 10
spline input shaft.  The T-15 has a 1 3/8" 6 spline output shaft.
It has a reputation as the strongest of the 3 speeds.

|  | The casting numbers on the T-15 are on the passenger side near the
top back. |
|  | Here's a top view of a T-90 and a T-15.  The T-90 has an adapter on
the front for the Dauntless V6, the adapter was probably originally
on a T-86.  The front of each transmission is even to show how much
longer the T-15 is compared to the T-90. |

### Usage

The T-15 was used only in V8 equipped CJs and Jeep trucks
from 1972 to 1975.
