The T-86 is a 3 speed transmission with a casting number of T86
and a 1 1/8" 10 spline input shaft.  Length of input shaft varies
with application.  Output is 1 3/8" 6 spline.  The T-86 case and
other parts are interchangable with with the T-90.

The T-86 uses a factory transmission to bell housing adapter.  The
adapter has the standard Chevy transmission bolt pattern and it bolts to
Chevy, Buick, Pontiac, etc. bell housings.  These bell housings
are the same on the transmission side.  There are more pictures
of a T-90 with this adapter on the T-90 and T-15 pages.

### Usage

The T-86 was only used behind the "Dauntless" Buick V6 in
in CJs and Jeepster Commandos during the late 60s.
