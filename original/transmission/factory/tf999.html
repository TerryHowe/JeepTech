<p>
The Torque Flite 999 is a medium duty Chrysler 3 speed automatic
transmissions.  They have an aluminum case and a 23 spline
output shaft.  The case is ??" long and ?? bolts hold in the pan.</p>
<p>
Modern versions are still use the 23 spline output,
but engine bolt patterns have changed and the newer ones have
electronic shift control.  I have conflicting information about
torque converters.  Some say early models did not have a lock up
torque converter and some say they did.  Newer models have a lock
up torque converter.

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
The TF 999 was used in CJs from 1980-1986 only with the I6 and V8
engine.  It was also used in 1984-1990 SJs and J pickups with the
4.2L engine, in the YJ from 1987-1991 with the 2.5L and 4.2L engine,
and in the XJ in 1991 with the 2.5L engine.  A modern version of the
999 continues to be used in Wrangler YJs and TJs to this day with
the I6 engine.
