<h2>Suspension Essentials</h2>
<h3>Functions of the Suspension</h3>
<h3>Leaf Spring Jeeps</h3>
<h4>Full, 3/4, 1/2, and 1/4 Eliptical</h4>
<p>
All the Jeeps that have been produced with leaf springs, have used
1/2 eliptical springs.  There is one arc attached at either end.
Lately there has been a trend to use 1/4 and 3/4 eliptical springs
on Jeeps to get more articulation.  On 1/4 eliptical springs, there
is 1/4 of an arc attached at one point on the frame and on the other
on the axle tube.  The 3/4 eliptical suspension attaches to the frame
at one point, to the axle tube, to a shackle that attaches to another
1/4 arc that attaches to the frame.
