### Suspension Tricks

|  | [Flip Your U-Bolts](/susp/ubolt.html):
Are you tired yet of dragging, bending, and breaking your axle
u-bolts on rocks?  Well flip your u-bolts to gain ground clearance
and protect them from damge. |

|  | [3/4 Elliptical Suspension](/susp/elliptical.html):
Craig Meyer's 3/4 elliptical suspension is surprisingly simple and
elegant. The tools to build it can be found in most garages and the
parts won't cost an arm and a leg. |
|  | [Big Tire, Little Lift](/tire/fit33.html):
The best set up for your Jeep is to use the least amount of lift possible to fit your target tire size.  Here's how to optimize. |
|  | [Wrangler YJ Travel Trick](/susp/yjsh.html):
This simple trick can increase the travel of your Jeep Wrangler's rear axle. |

[Pieces and Parts Suspension](http://www.4x4wire.com/jeep/projects/pieces/susp/):
Since this project is called "Pieces and Parts", you can't expect
anything to be normal and this is true for the suspension. The
suspension is not radical, but it is practical and should
perform well.
### Installing a Spring Over Lift Kit

|  | [Wrangler Axle Swap and SOA](/convaxle/fordeb/):
Chris Waterman tells us how he swapped an early Bronco Ford 9"
and Dana 44 into his Wrangler YJ.  The transformation was enhanced
with a spring over axle lift at the same time. |

|  | [Scout Dana 44s under a YJ](/convaxle/ihscout/):
When evaluated as a hard-core off-road vehicle, the Jeep YJ is
often praised for its excellent fuel-injected motor and panned for
its weak axles and low, limited-articulation suspension.  This
is nothing a spring over with Scout Dana 44s won't cure. |
|  | [CJ Spring Over Axle](/susp/cjsoa.html):
John Nutter explains how he did a spring over axle lift
on his CJ using YJ springs.  His Jeep now easily ramps
over 1000 and he saved cash for other upgrades. |

### Functions of the Suspension
### Leaf Spring Jeeps
#### Full, 3/4, 1/2, and 1/4 Eliptical
All the Jeeps that have been produced with leaf springs, have used
1/2 eliptical springs.  There is one arc attached at either end.
Lately there has been a trend to use 1/4 and 3/4 eliptical springs
on Jeeps to get more articulation.  On 1/4 eliptical springs, there
is 1/4 of an arc attached at one point on the frame and on the other
on the axle tube.  The 3/4 eliptical suspension attaches to the frame
at one point, to the axle tube, to a shackle that attaches to another
1/4 arc that attaches to the frame.

### Shackle Reversal

[Pros and Cons of Shackle Reversal](/susp/elkcahs/):
Shackle reversal is one
of the most misunderstood Jeep suspension modifications. The
pros and cons of shackle reversal should be understood before
you spend your hard earned money on a kit.
