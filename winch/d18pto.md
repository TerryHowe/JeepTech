This is how the Koenig Dana 18 PTO adapter looks from behind.  The
adapter would bolt on at a slight angle so that the shift lever
would be more upright.

From the side you can see how relatively thin the adapter is.  A
small chain inside the aluminum case takes power from the drive gear
and transfers it to the PTO shaft gear.
