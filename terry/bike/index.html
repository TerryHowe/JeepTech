Bicycling has been my primary hobby more than any other
hobby.  Lately biking has taken a bit of a back burner, I've
barely ridden this year.  It is hard to find time to play
hockey two nights a week and keep the Jeep running <i>and</i>
ride.  Part of the problem, is most of the decent parks
in the area have been recently closed to Mt. biking.

I'm due for a bit of a biking break anyway, since
last summer I spent two straight months on my bike.
I have started on a trip report of my <a href="odyssey.html">odyssey</a>
across the United Sates with Diane in the summer of 1994.

Right now I have two Trek 970s.  One is set up for off-road
with Specialized suspension fork and big nobbies. The
other is set up for touring with road slicks, bike rack,
and lots of water bottle cages.
