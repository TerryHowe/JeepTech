<p>
I have a '81 Jeep CJ-7 with 258(4.2L) I6.  A cast aluminum valve cover
from Clifford keeps most of the oil from spraying out of the 258.
A Centerforce clutch transfers power from the engine to a
Ford T-18 4 speed.  The T-18 is mated to a Dana 300
transfer case with an adapter from Advanced Adapters.
The Dana 300 features a Currie twin stick shifter.

<p>
I recently swapped my 3.54 geared axles for a custom front Dana
44 and a Jeep Commando rear Dana 44.  These axles are geared with
4.27:1 ring and pinion on Detroit Soft Lockers.  The front Dana 44
was built by Predator Four Wheel Drive in Colorado Springs and features
what ever lock outs I have lying around that aren't broken.  The
Commando 44 I bought from Darron Birenheier
in upstate New York.  The Commando 44 is a great, low buck, bolt on
upgrade for '76â€“'86 CJs.  The final crawl ratio, thanks to the T-18,
is 6.32*2.6*4.27=70.2:1.
</p>
<p>
It also has a 2 1/2" suspension lift
made up of Rancho springs, Con-fer shackles, and Dick
Cepek shocks.  I painted the shocks black and used black
boots so it won't look like a show truck.  All this makes
plenty of room for 32"X11.50" BFG Mud Terrains.

<p>
The "interior" features a custom 6 point roll cage with two outside
spreaders, two inside spreaders, and a bar across the dash.  The two
inside spreaders surround a console for a Radio Shack CB and a dome
light.  The gauges are stock except for Sunpro Tachometer and vacuum
gauges.  Tunes are provided by an Acoustic Tape/Radio and amp with
some extra speakers on the roll bar.
</p>
<p>
In case of trouble, a Warn 8274 winch is
mounted on the front.  This winch is rated to pull 8,000 pounds
on the first wrap of the 150ft spool of 5/16" cable.  Too keep the winch
running, I have dual Die Hards in a Wrangler Power Products battery
tray.  The batteries are wired in with a Wrangler Power Products
Isolator and battery manager.  A winch accessory kit helps me make
pulls at angles and without damaging the environment.

<p>
There is a RockWare bumper on the front and a Tomken bumper on the
rear.  The rocker panels are protected with Off Your Rocker rocker
panel guards.
I also have a high lift jack and a big beafy 4"
tow strap.
</p>
<p>
Early this year I did a power steering conversion, added York
compressor, and a 26 gal Aero fuel tank.  I still haven't converted
the air conditioning compressor for on board air.  Belts
are hooked up, but the plumbing isn't.

RockWare Bumper Review
</a>:
RockWare has recently introduced a new bumper for CJs and Wranglers.
The bumper integrates a winch mount into the bumper which gives the
bumper a very clean appearance.</p>

<h1>Family Jeep History</h1>
<img src="/images/terry/cj7/jeepmom.jpg" alt="Jeep Mom">

<p>
In my family, Jeeping is a bit of a tradition.  My parents had a
Wagoneer when I was growing up that unfortunately rusted to
pieces before I managed to become a licenced driver.  Pictured
above is my Grandfather, Mother, and Grandmother with their
Willys Wagon in 1951.  They are cooking up some dinner on their
cross country trip.
</p>
<p>
My first Jeep was a '78 CJ-5 with 258 I6 and Jeep T-18.  The
body had an extreme rust problem and the carb needed rebuilding.
Basically everything was wrong with it.  I'm still sorry I
sold it.  Second Jeep is the current Jeep '81 CJ-7.  I also
owned a '93 Wrangler for two years.  It was a real nice ride.
