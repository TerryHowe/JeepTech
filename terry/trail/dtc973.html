Our group from Old Miner finished up early, so most of us decided to
check out Mount Moriah.  Mount Moriah starts out with a rocky and muddy
hill climb and continues on with some wicked off-camber sections.  The
hill climb isn't too tough, but the off-camber sections require
careful driving.</p>
<p>
After the off-camber section, I was heading down
a steep decent when smoke started pouring out of my dash.  I jumped
out of my Jeep with my fire extinguisher in hand.  The smoke had a foul
smell and seemed to be coming from my engine compartment.  I struggled
for what seemed like hours with my hood lock (I now leave a key in it
when wheeling).  By the time I got the hood open, the quantity of smoke
was dropping.  It seemed to be coming off my exhaust manifold and it
didn't take me long to figure out that it was power steering fluid.
It turned out I had a pin hole in my high pressure hose that was
spraying power steering fluid around the engine compartment.   I was
able to patch it with a spare hose clamp.</p>

We continued on and stopped on top of of Strawberry Ridge for a look
out over the Valley and the town of Deadwood.  Behind Deadwood, we
could see a gigantic mine.  It turns out is the worlds largest open
pit gold mine in the world, they just keep finding more gold there.</p>
<p>
On the descent from Strawberry Ridge, we stopped at a memorial to Teddy
Rosevelt.  Our tail gunner, Douglas Jones,  entertained us with some
amusing ghost
stories from the town of Deadwood and we jumped in our trucks to
finished the decent into town.  Another great day of four wheeling!</p>
