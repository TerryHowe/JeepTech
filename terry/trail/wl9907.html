August ??, 1999<br>

<p>
Well, it was a night run, so no pictures of us going to the lake at
night, but Sean and I headed back up to the lake in the morning...
Eric Resko broke down before the first obstacle, but his friend
made it up in his TJ (not to the lake).  Keith broke in his TJ
on this trail as well, it had less than a 1000 miles on it.  He
made it up to the water fall, but when he saw it, he had second
thoughts.</p>
<p>
For me, the highlight of the trip was catching big air going up the
waterfall at night.  It was raining out and all I could see was the
rain and clouds in my head lights.
