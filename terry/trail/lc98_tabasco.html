It is a long drive over dirt roads to get to the trail head for The
Tabasco Twister, but it is well worth the drive.  Many of the big
dogs showed up to run this new, challenging trail.  I was one of the
"runts" of the pack since I was only sporting 33s, fortunately I
was near the end of the line, so I had plenty of time to evaluate
the terrain.

The trail starts
with several very technical boulder fields that lead to the
first big ledge.  In order to make the ledge, you need climb up onto
an off-camber section to the right.  If you don't make it, you
end up like the picture of me to the left.  I spun around on the ledge
like a top and high centered with both front wheels off the ground.
I'm mainly caught on my spring hangers and my muffler there.  My
muffler partially ripped apart on that obstacle.

<p>
After the first big ledge, there are two off camber sections.  The
choice is to try to climb the rocks on the left or risk body damage
by taking the off-camber line to the right.  Without a spotter it
is easy to fall off the rocks and get hung up and the off-camber
line was slippery causing quite a few dings.

After the off-camber sections was the second major ledge known as
The Abyss.  It is named the Abyss for the large wash out on the
passenger side, falling in would be as good as bottomless.  This
obstacle proved difficult even for the big dogs.  More people took
the strap here than anywhere else, some walked right up it.

It is rare to find women wheeling and rarer yet to find women wheeling
extreme trails.  Diane and her husband came all the way down from
<A href="lc98c.jpg"><IMG src="lc98c_.jpg" alt="Dave on the hill" align="right"></A>
Minnesota to wheel the trails and she proved herself very capable.
</p>

<p>
After The Abyss, there was ledge after ledge.  None of the ledges
could match The Abyss, but most were very difficult.  Progress was
slow and the strap was thrown more than once.  With all the
trucks on the trail, we didn't hit pavement until well after dark.
