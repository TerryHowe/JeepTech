Ray driving over one of the stone steps on the Wolf Run.
Wayne Bennett (aka Flatlander) covered our trip through
<A HREF="http://www.4X4NOW.com/nmlc7c.html">Wolf Run</A>
on his <A HREF="http://www.4X4NOW.com/">4x4NOW web page</A>.
He included pictures of three Big Horn 4x4 club members: Ray Bork (Blue EB),
Dave Vest (Green EB), and Chris Long (Blue YJ), but none of me.
He also covered our run in Alamagordo, <A HREF="http://www.4X4NOW.com/trnmg.html">The Gauntlet</A>.
