The first major obstacle was optional and about half the people skipped it, but after that we started hitting obstacles that weren\'t optional. The [Iceman](dtc971.html) struck fast freezing us in our tracks. [![Old Miner](/images/terry/trail/sd9708_.jpg)](dtc972.html)\

After Carbonate, we dropped into Chism Gulch and stopped for lunch at the base of Heckman Hill, aka Widowmaker Hill. Heckman Hill is the most challenging part of the [Old Miner](dtc972.html) and it requires lots of throttle no matter what modifications you may have made to your vehicle.

[Mount Moriah](dtc973.html) starts out with a rocky and muddy hill climb and continues on with some wicked off-camber sections. The hill climb isn\'t too tough, but the off-camber sections require careful driving. After the off-camber section, I was heading down a steep decent when smoke started pouring out of my dash.
