This year\'s Wheeler Lake trip turned out to be a Family trip. Ray and Leah, brought Rose and Nathan, Paul brought Jeremy, Guest Brian & Chris brought Debra, Kevin, Joanna brought Catherine, and John and Audrey brought Rat and Scrapper. In all six vehicles (four Jeeps, a Bronco and a Four-Runner) braved the wet Colorado Springs weather to venture out into forecasted inclement weather.

On the way up, the trail conditions were good and the wild flowers were spectacular due to the unusual amount of rain in July. Everyone seemed to enjoy a good family trail ride; however, our choice of weekends was lacking and a log-jam of 18 vehicles were in front of us at the last obstacle below the Lake. It turned out to be a group from Just-Four-Fun. The size of the group and difficulty of the last obstacle halted our progress.

Some of the group ventured on foot to see the Lake. It was described as \"just up the hill a few hundred yards.\" Going just up with kids in tow proved to be quite a work out at 12 thousand feet. About an hour later the foot bound explores returned (the large group was still trying to get past the last obstacle) and the afternoon rains were starting. With the weather turning, the group decided to head back to the Springs. Not doing the last obstacle was disappointing for some, but will give us a good excuse to go back next time.
