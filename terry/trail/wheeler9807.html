Since Jacob was unable to lead his trip to Wheeler, I volunteered to lead
in his place.  I, Curtis, Paul, Brian, and Joe (a guest driving a Toyota
4Runner) departed Red Rocks at 8:04 a.m. and headed for Fairplay.  Upon
arrival in Fairplay, we gassed up and met Ray, Lea, and kids.  We then
headed towards Hooser pass and the trail head.  We met (Terry and Diane)
and (Bill and Krista) at the trail head.  We aired down, dialed in, and
headed up the trail.</p>
<p>
At the first obstacle Bill decided to try and
replant a downed tree with his truck.  The tree refused and kept a marker
light and CB antenna for a momento.  A little while later, Brian (another
guest, driving an orange Land Rover) joined us.  The rest of the trip
up to the lake was uneventful.</p>
<p>
At the lake we met Jerry and Julie from
Predator, visiting with them while we ate lunch.  Apparently someone
left their female Husky at the lake and Jerry and Julie took care of it
over night while they were camped there.  It had an ID tag on its collar
so the owners were contacted and Bill and Krista were kind enough to
meet them in Denver to facilitate its return.  The trip home was also
uneventful.  As far as I know, a good time was had by all and no one
missed the heat at home.
