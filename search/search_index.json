Larger tires gain ground clearance, increase maximum fording depth, and increase the angles of departure and approach, but they often don't work well with OEM gearing. Auto manufactures build trucks for the street, which means they select high gearing for fast acceleration and better gas mileage. When larger tires are put on these trucks, the driver may find themselves burning through clutches because first gear is so high. Engine performance and gas milage may suffer because the engine is forced to work outside of it's optimal RPM ranges. Top speed on the highway will increase, but so will low speed on the trail.</p> <p>There are two main motivations to regear, the first is to return the truck to the manufactures operating ranges to improve engine performance and decrease wear and tear on the clutch and transmission. The second is to increase off-road performance with lower gearing. Lower gearing allows the off-roader to go slower through obstacles giving the driver better control so there is less chance of vehicle damage and occupant injury. There is a penalty for low gears on top highway cruising speed. The gear and tire form is designed to allow the user to try different configurations and see what performance will be like for different configurations before going through an expensive gear swap.</p>"},{"location":"applications/gear/#general-information-on-gear-ratios","title":"General Information on Gear Ratios","text":"<p>One important aspect of gear ratios is numerically large gears are the low ones. Gear ratios are normally stated in the form x.xx:1, e.g. 6.32:1. This translates mathematically to 1/6.32, and since 1/2 is more than 1/6, 6:1 is lower than 2:1. The ratio means that for every 6.32 revolutions from the input the output will rotate once. This happens to be granny low first gear on a Ford T-18 transmission. When you are in first with the T-18, the engine does 6.32 revolutions for every 1 revolution the transmissions outputs.

Each transmission gear is printed out as a separate line in the graph first being red, second blue, third green, fourth black, and fifth yellow. A check box at the bottom of the graph allows the user to \"shift\" the transfer case into low range. The title of the graph gives the users tire size and ring and pinion ratio.</p> <p>The tabular output is also produced each time the calculate button is pressed. The title on the tabular output indicates the units of output either KPH or MPH. It also indicates the users selection of tire and ring and pinion and allows the user to enter different RPMs to see the table at various engine outputs.

The columns represent high and low range of the transfer case.</p> <p>The crawl ratio, which is often used to compare gearing set ups, is also included in the tabular output. The crawl ratio represents compound low, or first gear of the transmission and low range of the transfer case. For example, many Wranglers have a first gear around 3.83:1, the transfer case low range is 2.72:1, and the axle ring and pinion is 3.07:1. This means the crawl ratio is 3.832.723.07 or around 32:1.

It takes three of these components to calculate the diameter of the tire. It sure is not a very straight forward sizing convention.</p> <p>The prefix is used to indicate general use of the tire. The tire input field trys to ignore the prefix and if your prefix causes an error, just don't input it. The Gear and Tire Applet currently will successfully ignore 'P' for passenger car and 'LT' for light truck. When in doubt, drop the prefix.</p> <p>The width simply the width of the tire in mm. For example the tire size P215/75R15 has a width of 215mm.</p> <p>The next component is the aspect ratio. The aspect ratio is the percentage of the width that makes up the sidewall of the tire. In the above example the aspect ratio is 75 or 75%, so the sidewall height is 75% of 215 or 161.25mm. If you want the diameter of the tire, you need to take into account that the diameter of the tire passes two sections of the side wall. This means the sidewall takes up 161.25*2 or 322.5mm of the diameter.</p> <p>The next component is the wheel size. In the above example the wheel size is 15\". If you convert the total sidewall into inches you get 322.5mm*0.03937in/mm or about 12.7\". Add that to wheel size and you get the diameter 15\"+12.7\" is 27.7\".

To calculate the circumference of a circle the Gear and Tire Applet uses the classic formula 2(pi)r, or given the diameter it is simply the diameter times pi. This means in the above example a 27.7\" tire has a circumference of 27.7(pi) or around 87\". Every time the tire rotates once, the vehicle travels 87\". This can be converted to miles or kilometers for calculations of speed given the number of engine revolutions per hour. Anyway looking at the simple formula d(pi) it is clear that a larger tire travels further for each revolutions since it has bigger circumferences. That is why when larger tires are swapped in, you go faster.</p>"},{"location":"applications/gear/#transmissions","title":"Transmissions","text":"<p>The Gear and Tire Applet allows you to enter up to five speeds and a reverse gear ratio.

The pinion takes input from the driveshaft and turns the ring. The ring spins the differential which turns the axle shafts. There are a fairly wide variety of ring and pinions ratios available anywhere from 2.73:1 to 6.50:1 depending on the model of the axle. Since transmission and transfer case ratios are fairly set, a change of ring and pinion is the easiest and least expensive way to modify the gearing of your 4x4.</p> <p>Figuring out what ratio ring and pinion you have is not always easy. Depending on engine, transmission, and option package the manufacturer may have used any one of several ratios. The easiest way is to locate and try to read the tag on on the differential housing. Sometimes this tag is located on the differential housing cover, sometimes it is not. It may be a a code stamped in the housing that needs to be looked up in your technical service manual.</p> <p>One sure fire way of determining your ratio is opening up the axle and taking a look. Often the ring is stamped with tooth count, ratio, and build date. Sometimes it isn't stamped, but you can still count the teeth yourself and divide ring teeth by pinion teeth to get the ratio.</p> <p>An easier, but not as accurate method of determining your ratio is to jack one wheel off the ground and count the number of drive shaft rotations it takes to turn the tire one full rotation. Multiply this number by two and that is your ratio. If you have a looking or limited slip differential, you may find it difficult to rotate the tire by hand. If this is the case lift both tires off the ground and support the vehicle with jack stands to count rotations for one rotation of both tires.</p> <p>One final note on ring and pinion, if you know the ratio of one axle the other should be the same give or take a few hundredths.

Sometimes, these modifications make speedometer recalibration necessary. Any change in the ring and pinion or tire size can throw off the speedometer. The simple way to calculate the proper speedometer driven gear is by setting up a ratio.

For example, if you had 225/75R15 tires (approximately 28.2\" in diameter) and you swap in 33s, you would set up the following ratio:</p> <pre><code>newGear * 33 = 27 * 28.2\n\nnewGear = (27*28.2) / 33\n\nnewGear = 23.07  (23 tooth gear)\n</code></pre> <p>The calculation for a ring and pinion swap from 2.73:1 to 4.27:1 would look like:</p> <pre><code>newGear/4.27 = 27/2.73\n\nnewGear = (27/2.73) * 4.27\n\nnewGear = 42.23 (42 tooth gear)\n</code></pre> <p>Determining the old speedometer driven gear is very simple.

In the above example the aspect ratio is 75 or 75%, so the sidewall height is 75% of 215 or 161.25 mm. If you want the diameter of the tire, you need to take into account that the diameter of the tire passes two sections of the side wall.

The ratio is an approximation of the number of turns of input for every one turn of output.

This means you'll be moving a lot slower in the same gear as someone with 2.73:1 R&amp;P. When you are off-road, lower gears (numerically high) allow you to take obstacles slower and the slower you'll go on steep decents. The slower you go, the more control you have and you are less likely to break something.</p> <p>So why are 4.27:1 axles lower than 2.73:1 axles you ask? Well, if you look at ratios as fractions, you will see that 1/4.27 is less than 1/2.73.

If R&amp;P came in a 10 tooth pinion gear and a 40 tooth ring gear, the same 10 teeth would be hitting the same teeth on the ring gear every revolution. If an odd ratio is chosen, the teeth are meshing with different teeth all the time and no regular wear pattern develops.

When axles are built, there is normally a tag bolted to the differential cover or a code stamped on the differential housing.

You know how the saying goes \"Only in a jeep\", I think it should be \"only to a jeep (must you replace everything)\" :)</p> <p>Ok, here is the basic project: I got a 78 Scout's Dana 44s for $200 and threw them under my jeep. The rear took about 4 hours total, just torch the spring perches off and reweld them over about 3/4\" each. The front however was a different story. The spring perches could not be moved over due to the diff. Housing occupying the necessary space. So the old spring hangers were unbolted on the front and drilled and cut on the rear (of the front springs). Then rewelded over about an inch and a quarter. Side braces were put on the front (rear) spring hangers, so a triangle extended from the frame. The front shackle was just bolted on to a piece of 1/4\" angle iron scrap that I got with the scout front springs (I didn't end up using the scout's springs). Also, the front drive shaft had to be shorted an inch.</p> <p>The other real headache was the steering gear swap. I looked at a few junkyards before I found one that looked like it would work right as far as mounts and that wasn't as loose as mine. I ended up with one from an old olds. Delta 88. I didn't get an excellent deal on it at $75, but the guy threw in the pump, hoses, steering shaft, and pitman. The steering shaft turned out to be most useful. NOTE: (it has been said before) the U-joints in the steering shaft are also a major culprit in the loose steering equation.</p> <p>Anyway, the delta 88 steering shaft was cutover and the Jeeps pounded apart and the two slid together (using the Delta 88's lower section and Jeeps upper section). The telescoping (safety) part of the stock Jeep was kept (at full extended length). The completed (fabricated) rod was welded together. The steering gear itself bolted right in, although it was only a three bolt, instead of 4.</p> <p>Overall conclusions: Well, the front was a real pain in the rear. In retro though maybe I would have tried to see how long I could have gone without breaking the stock dana 30 before going to the scout's big dana 44. Every tire does stick out about an inch more that stock. Backspacing to over come this looks impossible, at least with 15\" wheels.

No one has ever written a guide to help you do it yourself (at least not that I know of). Because of this, I wasn't sure I'd be able to do the job myself. Among the rumors I had heard were that:</p> <ul> <li>I would need a 50-ton press to get the old tubing out of the knuckle.</li> <li>I would never get the geometry right</li> <li>Do you really think you can do something yourself that shops need ten of thousand dollars worth of equipment to do?</li> </ul> <p>Here's what I did and how I did it.</p> <p>I started with an axle housing from a narrow track '78 Cherokee and knowledge I gained from the Jeep tech list and members of my club. I lucked into getting the complete front end for $40, so I wasn't too worried about ruining it.</p> <p>The first thing I did was to set the Dana 44 in front of my Jeep and start measuring. The spring pads were about 32 inches apart, 4 inches wider than my CJ. The overall length was around 61 inches from wheel mounting surface to wheel mounting surface and my CJ wide-track front end was 56 inches. The distance from the spring pads to the wheel mounting surface was pretty close to my CJ, so I reasoned that I could leave the short side alone and shorten the long side about 4 inches. This agreed with everything I had read on Jeep-tech, so I decided to go ahead with it.</p> <p>I also checked caster and pinion angles. My CJ had about 0 degrees of caster, the spring pads were parallel with the floor and the pinion was about 5 degrees up relative to the floor. This isn't the standard way of measuring pinion angle, I was just trying to measure the relative angle between the spring pads and pinion angle, so I could duplicate it on the new front end. Then I measured it out on the Dana 44 front end. With the spring pads parallel to the floor, the pinion was 12 degrees up and the caster was at 0 degrees. This is a great thing, it meant I could cut 7 degrees out of the cast in the spring pad on the housing, the other spring pad has to be moved anyway. The result would be a pinion angle of 5 degrees up (relative to the floor) and 7 degrees of caster without cutting and turning the inner knuckle on the short side.</p> <p></p> <p>The first step was to remove the brakes, rotors, spindles and outer knuckles, shafts, and differential carrier. This is all well-documented elsewhere, so I won't go into detail here. I stripped it down to the bare housing except I left the pinion in (no reason, I just didn't feel like removing it). Next I used a 4\" grinder to remove the spring perch and shock mount from the long axle tube. I gouged the tube a bit in doing this so I welded up the gouges and ground them smooth again.</p> <p>Next, I re-cut the spring perch cast into the center section to give me the proper pinion angle. I had to take off more than 1/4\" of metal at one end and taper down to none removed at the other. I started by setting the axle on jack stands with a third jack stand under the pinion. I carefully adjusted and shimmed the jack stand under the pinion until I had the housing positioned just right. I set it up so that the final pad angle would be correct if I held the grinder level. I installed a new wheel on the grinder and started at the thick end. I pushed the grinder across using the edge to cut away the metal, stopping to check the angle several times. Eventually I was finished. The spring pad looks great and is perfectly flat. I am very pleased with the results, although it did take a long time and I went through three grinding wheels.</p> <p> The next step was the actual cutting of the tube. I brought the housing down to my friend Tim Norstad's house because he has a chop saw and is always generous with his tools. I had already measured and marked the tubing at home. This is not difficult, just remember that the tube sticks into the inner knuckle a bit, so don't cut the tubing off at 4\" away from the knuckle. I'm not going to give an actual measurement here because I'm not positive everyone's axle housing will be identical to mine. I purposely cut my tubing about 1/8\" short in case I decided to weld where the end of the tube meets the knuckle. The tubing wasn't any more difficult to cut than any other piece of metal that size. After the tube was cut to size, I had a short piece of tube still attached to the inner knuckle. Tim and I cut that tube off as close to the knuckle as possible.</p> <p>When I got home, I clamped the inner knuckle in my vice and started grinding off the bead and old tube where it attached to the knuckle. The guys in my club said to grind until I just started to see a line or crack between the tube and the knuckle. Their next suggestion was to press out the old tube with a hydraulic press. I don't have a press so I tried hammering it with a 3 lb hammer and punch. This did nothing. Then I put the knuckle back in the vice, took my hacksaw apart and put the blade through the center and reconnected it. I made two cuts about 90 degrees apart and then easily drove out the pieces of tubing one at a time.</p> <p>This left me with a free outer knuckle and a tube it needed to go on. I had heard that I would definitely need a press for this part but I had done it all myself so far, I wasn't going to stop here without at least trying. I cleaned the rust and weld splatter off the tube and ground a small bevel all the way around the edge. Next I started tapping the knuckle on with a 1 lb ball peen hammer. It was working. I had to hit it hard, but not so hard I was worried about bending breaking anything.</p> <p>After the outer knuckle was on 1/2\" I stopped and set the caster. To do this I set the housing up on jack stands again, this time I set it so that the surface for the nut of the lower ball joint on the still attached knuckle was level. Then I tapped the free knuckle until it matched. From here I drove it on the rest of the way, stopping may time to measure. After I had it in place I spent 2 hours with a tape measure and angle finder making sure everything was right. I tack welded it and let it sit for a week before I spent another hour measuring again.</p> <p></p> <p>The only thing left was to weld the knuckle on. If you aren't sure about your welding skills or your welder doesn't have a high enough amp rating it would be best to leave it to a professional welder. One important note is that the weld doesn't carry the weight of the vehicle because the tubing sticks into the inner knuckle about an inch. I have heard of people butt welding the knuckle to the tube (they didn't remove the old tube from the knuckle, just cut it flush and rewelded). This sounds incredibly weak and dangerous to me, not to mention the difficulty of lining up the pieces. The fact that the tube is so far into the knuckle and such a tight fit in the knuckle gives me the confidence to know it is strong and lined up properly.</p> <p>I re-installed the outer knuckles, spindles and rotors to check out the front end. The actual distance from wheel mounting surface to wheel mounting surface is 57 inches. My wheels will stick out 1/2\" farther than they did before. All the angles check out right, and it looks like it should bolt in with no problems.</p> <p>What's left? I need to send the long side inner axle shaft in to be shortened. I need to weld the spring pad and shock mount for the long side back on. I need new ball joints and U-joints. I need to decide about the steering and brakes.</p> <p>There are many steering and brake options available to me by mixing and matching Jeep, Chevy, Ford and Scout II disc brake parts, so this won't be a problem. My current thought is to use the Cherokee outer knuckles, spindles and Chevy type brakes with F-150 rotors (F-150's have the same 5 on 5 1/2\" wheel bolt pattern as Jeep CJ's). There are two advantages to this: 1) I will get the stronger and less leaky internal type lockouts and 2) The Cherokee tie rod mounts on top of the knuckles and is much larger and stronger than a CJ tie rod.</p> <p>Another possibility is using my stock outer knuckles, spindles, brakes and steering with Scout II outer axle shafts. Scout II outer axle shafts use the Dana 44 sized U-joint but are otherwise similar to CJ outer shafts. Or I could use non-disc brake CJ outer knuckles with my stock steering, Cherokee spindles, Chevy type brakes and F-150 rotors and hubs or I could... The possibilities are limitless.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"axle/upgrades/sjd44true/","title":"True Trac install","text":"<p>by John Nutter</p> <p></p> <p>I had a good day at the swap meet yesterday, I bought a 3-series True Trac for a Dana 44 with reverse rotations 3.50 gears attached for $50. I need to change the gears because I'm going to install it in a standard rotation front Dana 44. The front Dana 44 axle is from a '78 Cherokee that I shortened to CJ specifications.</p> <p>The True Trac went in very easily, mainly because I don't have the front end installed yet. The hardest part was removing the open carrier. I wrapped a cable around it and hung it from the ceiling to preload it while I pried on one of the ring gear bolts. The FSM doesn't say anything about hanging the whole axle from the ceiling by the carrier, but I don't have a case spreader. Either way it worked out. The FSM does say to pry on the case itself and the heads on the ring gear bolts to remove the carrier.</p> <p>After that I finally found my air impact wrench (and the trigger that had broken off it and migrated to the back of a drawer) and situated the Jeep, so I could run it and use the on-board air. The ring gear bolts came out very easily with the air impact.</p> <p>With the ring gear off, I dropped the True Trac into the housing and snugged it down to see how the bearing preload would be with the bearings and shims that came on the True Trac. It felt about right, so I decided to see how the backlash and gear pattern were with those bearings.</p> <p>Next I swapped the standard cut ring gear over to the true trac and pulled it uptight slowly and evenly with a ratchet. After it was good and tight, I applied lock tight to the bolts and snugged them up again. I couldn't figure out a way to hold the carrier for the final tightening (there are no holes in the sides of a True Trac to stick a pry bar into), so I used the air impact.</p> <p>After it was assembled, I set the carrier in the housing and slowly turned the bolts for the bearing caps to pull it down. I went in a chris cross pattern, about 1/2 a turn at a time. Once it was down, I checked the backlash and gear pattern. Amazingly, it was like I hadn't disturbed anything. Both were unchanged from before. The only thing that was different was slightly less bearing preload on the carrier, which is good because I think I had too much before. It now feels like it should.</p> <p>I saved the best for last, here's what I think I've learned from playing with the axles. I could be wrong on any of it, but this is how it's worked out for me:</p> <p>The pinion depth shims seem to go with the pinion. The carrier shims seem to go with the carrier. Meaning that if you are going to change a gear set that is already set up into another housing, try the shims from the original setup, rather than the ones that went with the housing. So far that's worked almost perfectly every time for me. If you are going to change from an open carrier to a different carrier that's already set up, try the shims that are already on the carrier. If you are going to a brand-new carrier, I'd try the shims from your old carrier first. When changing carriers without changing gears, I'd test fit the carrier, bearings and shims without the ring gear first to see how the bearing preload feels.</p>"},{"location":"axle/upgrades/sjd44true/#changing-bearings-and-shims","title":"Changing bearings and shims","text":"<p>If this is what scares you about doing gears, don't be scared. The carrier bearings are the hardest to remove, and they aren't that hard. For special tools you will need a decent sized bearing separator (about $15 from a discount tool place), a two-jaw puller (another $12 or $15) and some kind of spacer to put in the hole in the case for the puller to push on. Most people probably have some kind of spacer laying around that will work, or you can buy a wheel bearing race driver set and use one of the driver pucks for the spacer ($20 to $40). You put the bearing separator on the carrier bearing, put the puller on that and tighten it down until the bearing comes off.

Although I did not do a spring over conversion at the time of my axle swap, incorporating one would be possible. If you are planning on an SOA set up in a YJ, swapping in larger axles is an excellent idea especially considering that most SOA Jeeps I've seen are running 35 inch tires. After seeing the size difference in components, as well as the \"effectiveness\" of C clip axles, I would make the removal of the Dana 35C a must in an SOA conversion.</p> <p>Why swap to Dana 44s? The Dana 44s are significantly stronger than the stock YJ axles in all ways including shaft diameter, shaft spline count, ring and pinion size and axle housing size. Getting rid of the Dana 35C is one of the best things you can do to a Chrysler Jeep.</p> <p>Another advantage of swapping in a Dana 44 up front is it gives you something no YJ saw from the factory, manual hubs. Not just any hubs though, beefy 1/2 ton truck hubs. The tie rod is out of the way on top of the knuckles. The six lug wheel bolt pattern is stronger than the five and they look cool too.

The widths of both these axles are compatible and very similar to the dimensions of the stock YJ axles. There are 2 widths available in the SJs, the narrow track version is closer to the right width. The narrow track Wagoneer and Cherokee Jeeps lacked extensions on the fenders. You will find both right, and left hand drop differentials on these axles. The stock YJ has the diff on the driver's side. If you are keeping your original transfer case, a compatible front end must be found.</p> <p>When I performed my swap I opted to install the venerable Atlas II transfer case. If one wishes to incorporate a D300 transfer case into the swap, and get rid of the NP231, now is decision time. The CJs had diffs on the passenger side. Benefits include: longer drive shaft, GEARED Tcase, and IMO a better unit than the 231. As mentioned I did not install the D300. If you are interested in swapping in a Dana 300, check out the Scout Dana 300 conversion information.</p> <p>It wasn't until 1974 when Cherokees and Wagoneers started using the open knuckle Dana 44 that makes good swap material. Open knuckle axles allow a vehicle to have a better turning radius. The Wagoneers had disk brakes standard, but they were optional on the Cherokees until 1976.</p> <p>The pinion on the D35C axle is not perfectly centered, it is off set just a bit to the passenger side. Because the use of a CV type drive shaft is just about guaranteed on any lifted YJ, this pinion offset must be copied on the donor axle.

I always meant to get some stainless screws to cover the holes in the door, but I never got around to it. I don't think much water gets in through the small holes and the hard doors are in the garage for 2/3rds of the year anyway. It is also pretty dry where I live, so it isn't as much of an issue as it might be in a more humid climate.</p> <p>If you aren't sure about your local laws, get the passenger side mirror. Not all areas require a passenger side mirror, but some do.

Next, put down a layer or three of masking tape over the area you plan to cut to protect the paint and to make it easier to draw a line.</p> <p>The front of the fender will require some imagination and what you cut will depend on personal taste. To get a true flat fender look, you'll need to remove most of the round front part of the fender. You may want to scribe a guideline along the front grill since it will be challenging to see what you are cutting when you are cutting along the grill. Mark out both sides so you get an even look.</p> <p> Once you have the lines drawn, use a saber saw with a 24 tooth per inch blade or similar tool to remove the material.

If your bumper is too long, you won't be able to make a sharp enough right, and you'll be stuck on the crest or bounce back down. If you've been to Moab, it is like Bump Dump on Hell's Revenge with a turn at the top.</p> <p>Again, you might want to check local laws before chopping your bumper. You can cut your bumper really short like Mark did, or you can leave some. The easy way to tell the maximum amount of bumper to leave is by turning the wheel to the stop and taking a straight edge along the outside edge of the tire. Chop the bumper along this plane.

Eventually, this rust will become severe and the rear spring hanger will rip off, especially under hard use. Fixing this problem is not as hard or expensive as you might think.</p> <p>The great thing about '76-'86 CJs is the fully boxed frame. The frame is the strongest frame ever used in a CJ, great for four wheeling. One problem with it is the part above the rear spring hanger tends to collect dirt and moisture and eventually rust out. You'll notice most CJs of this vintage have suffered some damage in this area.</p> <p>After a trip to Lower Chinamen's Gulch, I noticed that familiar creaking sound when accelerating and braking that meant I'd cracked my frame and my spring hanger was about to rip off. I knew the sound because early in the year I ripped off a spring hanger after the Winter Meeting in Las Cruces. The fix I made last time was easy and cheap and it had survived a couple runs on Holy Cross and the trails of Moab. This time I decided to take some pictures.</p> <p>The fix only requires access to a welder, circular hand saw, air cut-off wheel, and drill. Instead of welding new metal to the frame, I bolted the repair to the frame using existing holes in the frame. The advantage of bolting the repair to the frame is there is no need to remove the gas tank or tub. Since I have an oversize gas tank, there was no way I was going to be able to weld on the repair without removing the tank. Making the repair without removing the tank saved me a day of work.</p> <p>The following supplies were used to complete the project:</p> <ul> <li>2 - 1/2\"x1\" coarse grade 5 bolts with nuts</li> <li>2 - 5/8\"x4\" coarse grade 5 bolts with nuts and lock washers</li> <li>Scrap of 3/16\" plate</li> </ul> <p> Start by putting the rear end of the Jeep up on jack stands and removing the bolts holding on the spring hanger. As soon as I removed the spring hanger, I could see the crack running along the boxing weld and across the lower part of the outer channel. Using an air cut-off wheel, cut the rest of the bottom piece of the channel and removed all the damaged material around the cracks. After removing the damaged material and cleaning it with a wire brush, spray it down with a rust converting primer.</p> <p>While the primer was drying, cut three pieces of 3/16\" plate. Cut two pieces 2 5/8\" X 9\" for the sides and cut one piece for the bottom 6\" long and 3 1/4\"wide, tapering out to 5\". I tapered the bottom piece so it was wide enough to use as a frame tie in with my bumper in the future.</p> <p> Using a pair of vice grip clamps, clamp the inside plate and the bottom plate in place so that the bottom edge of the inside piece was flush with the bottom plate. Mark the inside piece with the two holes that already exist in the frame rail for drilling. Remove the inside plate and clamp on the outside plate so that the bottom edge of the plate is flush with the top of the bottom plate. Mark the outside plate for drilling and the bottom plate for the spring hanger.</p> <p> Remove the plates and drill the inside and outside plates with a 5/8\" drill. One of the frame holes on the inside frame channel may also need to be enlarged to 5/8\", the other three holes should already be 5/8\". Drill the bottom plate with a 1/2\" bit and bolt a spring hanger to the plate. Weld the nuts to the top of the bottom plate.</p> <p>Once the drilling is complete, the hard work is done. Bolt the inside and outside plates in place and clamp on the bottom plate. Tack weld the three plates together and remove the whole thing. Complete the welding on the floor so you can get a good even bead. Since my exhaust routes out the corner, I also welded two 3/8\"x1 1/2\" bolts on the outside plate to act as a heavy-duty exhaust hanger. Bolt everything back together and you are all done.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"body/heater/","title":"Jeep Heater Blower Motor Upgrade","text":"<p>The Chevy Blazer heater motor upgrade for Jeep CJs and Wranglers has been bouncing around the net for as long as I can remember.

I don't have a complete part cross-reference, but any motor out of a Chevy pickup, GM pickup, Blazer, or Jimmy should work from '71 to '76. The motor may have the part number \"1312\" on it.</p>"},{"location":"body/heater/#steps-for-the-heater-motor-upgrade","title":"Steps for the Heater Motor Upgrade","text":"<p>The only thing tricky about doing the upgrade is you will have to enlarge the opening in the fire wall to 3 1/4\" to accommodate the larger diameter motor.

Other than that, the tools in most peoples tool box and anyone capable of changing their oil should be able to do the upgrade.</p> <p>Start by draining at least 1/4 of the coolant from your radiator. It might be a good time to put in some fresh coolant. If so, check with local laws on how to properly dispose of your coolant. Do not pour it in a storm sewer. For most animals, drinking coolant causes kidney failure, not a pleasant way to go. Be sure to \"burp\" the system when you refill the coolant.</p> <p> I have a dual battery tray, so for me it was easier to remove the tray to get access to the hoses and wires going to the heater. If you have a stock tray, you might be able to leave it.</p> <p>Disconnect the two hoses on the engine side of the fire wall that go into the heater core. There should be a wire nearby that plugs into your current heater motor, unplug it. Also remove the curved drain hose that drains the bottom of the heater. You may also need to remove the hose that drains the grill on the cowl.</p> <p> I removed all the bolts from my dash and pulled it out a bit to get easier access to my heater housing. It is possible to remove the heater without removing the dash, but it makes it easier to see what you are doing and you don't have to contort yourself under the dash to remove cables and wires.</p> <p>Next, you need to unhook all the ventilation control cables and wires that attach to the heater housing behind the dash. Also disconnect the defroster duct hose at the top of heater housing.</p> <p>Remove the four nuts that secure the heater housing on the engine side of the firewall. Three of them are pretty obvious near the heater hoses and heater motor, the other is near the middle of the fire wall behind the valve cover on my 258.</p> <p>After the nuts are removed, you are ready to wrestle your heater housing out.  When you get the heater housing on the garage floor, remove the screws from the back of the housing that hold the housing together. There was caulking around the cover, so it took some gentle prying to pull it apart.</p> <p>Remove the old motor and take the fan off of it and install the fan on your new motor. The new motor should be installed with no modifications on the heater housing. You might want to bench test the motor at this time to make sure it works and the fan is attached properly.</p> <p>Now it is time to enlarge the hole in your fire wall to make room for the new motor. I opted to make an octagon shaped hole with an air cut off wheel. The hole is not as clean, but it took me no time to do. I originally planned on using a 3 1/4\" hole saw, but this would have required removing the front fender to get my drill in there. The hole saw would also require me to attach a sheet metal plate to the fire wall so the pilot bit could hold the hole saw in place. A saber saw would work well, but it would also most likely require removing the front fender. A metal hand saw, other than a bow type hack saw, would probably work to enlarge the hole. Rod Gramlich wrote up the procedure he used to enlarge the hole with a hole saw. Other people have reported using a die grinder from the inside.</p> <p>Once the hole is enlarged, it is time to put everything back together. Before you get everything back together, you might want to test the motor, or at least bench test it. Don't start your Jeep without coolant.</p> <p> The seal from my original heater motor didn't go around the new motor, so I sealed it with some black silicon RTV. Some people report they have been able to reuse the seal.</p> <p>My heater motor had a large vent hole on the side that I covered with some duct tape to keep mud and water out. I have heard that not all the motors have this hole. Some motors come with a metal retaining clip to secure the motor from the outside, remove this clip.</p> <p> The larger heater motor interfered with my dual battery tray, so I had to cut a notch out of the tray to give the motor clearance.

If you leave your mirrors loose enough to move them out of the way, they get bumped out of adjustment all the time. If you tighten them up so they don't get bumped, you cannot move them out of the way. The QuickLever mirror release allows you to keep the mirrors tight and still move them out of the way with no tools.</p> <p>QuickLever mirror releases work on 1955-1986 CJs external mirrors. This style mirror is also a nice upgrade for Wranglersif you want to take the doors off.</p> <p>Installation of the QuickLever mirror release only takes a minute. Remove the bolt that holds on the mirror arm and put in the QuickLever. With the arm of the QuickLever concave out, tighten the nut down snug with your fingers. Flip the lever and it tightens down the mirror. After the QuickLever nut is properly set, you can just flip the lever to adjust the mirror or move it out of the way.</p> <p>I just had to get a set of QuickLevers for my CJ-6. I'd had a set on my CJ-7 years ago and loved the convenience. The cost of convenience of QuickLever cannot be beat.</p>"},{"location":"body/rockware/","title":"RockWare Bumper Review","text":"<p> by Terry Howe</p> <p>RockWare has recently introduced a stout new bumper for CJs and Wranglers.

The 8274 plate mounts the winch high enough so that the cable will clear the base plate even if it gets bunched up a bit.</p> <p>This version of the bumper does not have a receiver, but they will build it with a 2\" receiver if you request it.

I removed my old bumper and 8274 winch mount. I slid the new RockWare bumper under the winch and the holes lined right up. I slid the bolts from the winch mount in place and tightened her down. It is always tricky getting the nut on the bolt behind the power steering box. I just put the nut in the box end of a combination wrench to start the threads. You have to remove the wrench before it is tightened down you can't get the wrench out. You use the open side to complete the tightening.</p> <p>The four winch mount bolts secure the bumper in place, and the single unit looks a lot cleaner than mount and the bumper.

A couple guys in the club had spare parts tire carriers where they would have entire front axle outers to hold on their spare tire. All of these were done on fabricated tire carriers, but I figured I could build one off the stock spare tire carrier. I thought about it a while and what I came up with was so simple, I wished I'd done it sooner. This modification could also be done easily to many after market spare tire carriers.</p> <p>I've seen some spare parts tire carriers that even have a knuckle on them, but I figured spindle out would be enough for me. The tricky part is providing a mounting surface for the spindle that is out far enough that you can bolt a tire to the brake hub and not so far out that the tire becomes a giant lever waiting for the correct pressure to rip off your tire carrier.</p> <p>The first thing I did was remove the stock tire carrier and grind, cut, and pound out the three bolts that hold on the spare. After removing the mounting bolts, I cut off the end right off where the two cross braces come from the top bar to the box (see top picture). I then removed the internal brace inside the box. I took the original end of the box and bent it a bit so it fit inside the now shortened box. I welded this in place, then I took a piece of sheet metal and welded it over the end of the box so I had a clean surface on the outside with no holes. Next I broke out a 3 1/2\" hole saw I purchased for the project and cut a hole in the sheet metal. I took a spindle for a spare Dana 30 and placed it in the hole and marked out the bolt holes. Drilled out the holes and blasted the whole thing with flat black spray paint.</p> <p>After it was dry, I took a spindle with short axle shaft and bolted it on with five 7/16\"X3/4\" bolts. I slid on a brake hub with bearing and secured it with two spindle nuts and locking washer. A spare hub went on next which holds the short shaft in place. I didn't put on a spare rotor, I figured it would just add weight. I put a bunch of washers behind the studs to make up for the room of the missing rotor.</p> <p>I took my creation and bolted to the Jeep and put on my spare tire a 33\"x12.5\" BFG MT. It could have been about 3/4\" closer, but it looked great. It is \"full floating\" too, which will surprise someone when the lean against it and it begins to spin.</p>"},{"location":"body/spare/#field-testing","title":"Field Testing","text":"<p>I got the my full floating spare tire carrier done just before my trip to Las Cruces for the Winter Meeting. I hadn't tested it yet off road, so I was a bit nervous about it. It survived The Gauntlet, Wolf Run, and Broad Canyon with no problems and received rave reviews from other four wheelers.</p> <p>When I was wheeling out in Moab a couple months later, I was coming down a real steep rock and managed to bend the entire carrier up. Probably if I used a 33\"x9.5\" tire for a spare, this wouldn't be a problem, but I was using a full size spare.</p> <p>A couple weeks later the carrier came in handy when I was wheeling in Farmington. A friend managed to break a lock-out and sheer all the studs of in the brake hub except for one. Rather than drill out all the studs, we just used the lock-out and brake hub from my spare parts carrier. Currently it is bent up and has a ruined brake hub on it, but it still holds my spare!</p> <p>Spare parts tire carrier II coming soon...</p> <p></p> <p>July 23, 1997</p>"},{"location":"body/step03/","title":"The Cowboy StirrUP Step\u00ae","text":"<p>By: Terry L.

When you start putting bigger tires and a lift kit on your rig, it can be pretty hard to get in and out. Sure, you could put steps on the rig, but they generally hurt your break over angle and they often get damaged four wheeling. Redneck Concepts has come up with a solution to this problem, the The Cowboy StirrUP Step\u00ae.</p> <p>The step is a great way to get in and out of your Jeep. The step hangs from a hook off the door opening of the Jeep. When you aren't using the step, you unhook it and push it under the seat or throw it in the back. It isn't in the way when you are not using it. A standard step, you have to worry about them getting caught on a rock and you have to worry about damaging the step four wheeling. With the The Cowboy StirrUP Step\u00ae, it is only there when you need it.</p> <p>Looking at the step, my first thought was I was going to bang my shin on the side of the tub. My wife, Diane, thought the same thing, but it just doesn't happen. It is easy to swing up and into the Jeep with the step. It is a lot less stressful on the knees and arms to use the step because you don't need to be a contortionist to get in your Jeep.</p> <p>We've been using the step for a month now and it has been great.

The TJ fender flares provide more clearance allowing me to run larger tires without damaging the body. Aftermarket TJ fender flares come in various widths so there is plenty of fender covering the tires. The TJ fender flare also uses an integrated marker light that keeps my Jeep street legal even though I trimmed the fenders.</p>"},{"location":"body/tjflares/#front-wheel-well","title":"Front Wheel Well","text":"<p>The good part about using YJ or TJ front flares on a CJ is that the Wrangler front fenders are about 1 1/2\" longer than CJ front fender flares. The extra two inches in length on a Wrangler fender is located forward of the wheel well. This allows you to line up a Wrangler flare on a CJ fender with extra room in the back of the wheel well. The back of the front fender is where you will hit first with a big tire. The general shape of a Wrangler rear flare also gives you more room in the rear wheel well.</p> <p></p> <p>In the photos note where the rear of the front flare is with respect to the vertical body seam between the body and the metal fender. The TJ flare at the bottom of the rocker panel intersects this seam line. The CJ flare is a good 4-6\" forward of this seam. Also notice that the TJ flare is mounted higher on the fender than the CJ flare. This is not as easy to see in this photo, but it makes a big difference.</p> <p>Now comes the point of no return. Get out the saber saw and buy a new metal blade with 18-24 teeth per inch. I also found that hand tin snips were useful for some of the final trimming. You have to get yourself in the right frame of mind to cut your fenders, but once you do the job is really easy.</p> <p>Place the front flare up against the fender and adjust back and forth, up and down, until you fully understand where it is going to be located. Mark the body with a wax-marking pen so you know where the flare is to be located. You will be first cutting off the complete raised ridge, about a 1\" wide strip, around the entire wheel well except leaving some material at the front of the fender for mounting the flare. YJ and TJ fenders need a flat mounting surface plus this gives you more room. You will be cutting the rear of the wheel well opening flush with the wheel well liner. You can stop here and mount the flares, but it is easy to get much more room.</p> <p>I then carefully separated the wheel well liner from the fender along the entire rear seam. These are just spot welds. Drive a screwdriver into the seam to open it up and find the spot welds. I then took my sawzall, slipped the blade into the opened seam and cut through each spot weld. Obviously, the supports from the firewall to the wheel well liner need to be removed. (So far I have not replaced them and have been running this way for several months). I now made a vertical cut about two inches behind the shock going from the bottom of the wheel well liner up where it starts to bend over to form the top of the wheel well. This cut allows the complete rear of the wheel well liner to be pushed back. I pushed the rear of the wheel well back about 2 1/2 to 3\" as measured at the bottom of the saw cut. I then just pop-riveted a triangular strip of metal over this opening. Be careful that the final shape of the wheel well liner stays inside the frame rails, otherwise the tires will chew it up when you are turning. You will find that the charcoal canister on the drivers side will need to be relocated, the liner will come very close to the steering shaft, and the clearance for the clutch linkage may need to be accounted for.</p> <p>The passenger's side is a breeze and there are no interference problems unless you are still using the stock jack or running a big battery tray. The fender sheet metal at the rear of the wheel well was bent over 90 degrees to lay against the new wheel well liner. I made a couple of cuts so I was only bending a section about 3-4\" long at a time. (I'm not a body man.) This was pop-riveted to the liner and adds a fair amount of support to the liner since the fender is double thickness in this location. Obviously everything was carefully painted and sealed to prevent rust.</p> <p>The following two comparison pictures show that the leading edge of the TJ flare does not mate as nice as the CJ flare. The top front of the CJ fender has a more gradual bend downward than the Wrangler fenders. This can be seen in the photo showing the TJ flare and the fact that it does not mate perfectly to the fender in the front. Only trained eyes will note this area. Careful working of the CJ fender, particularly the raised ridge along the wheel well will minimize flaws in the fit in this region. The photos also show how much higher the TJ flare can be mounted compared to the CJ flare.</p> <p> </p> <p>Details of front corner of the flares.</p>"},{"location":"body/tjflares/#rear-wheel-well","title":"Rear Wheel Well","text":"<p> The rear wheel well is trivial compared to the front. The YJ or TJ flare will allow you to trim the sheet metal away from the front and back lower corners of the rear wheel well due to the general shape of the flare. This has helped most people since they hit the back edge first. The TJ rear flare has the same general shape as the YJ flare, but it can be mounted higher than the YJ flare. My rear TJ flare is mounted in the same position (height wise) as a CJ or YJ flare. There is over and inch of flare sticking out below the lower edge of the body, i.e., I could have mounted the flare at least an inch higher on the body. I didn't mount the flare higher since you don't hit the top of the rear wheel well and the bottom opening is monstrous.</p> <p> With only minor sheet metal cutting I have opened up the rear lip enough to clear my tires. Note: on the rear you are limited on the amount of opening you can do. The front of the rear wheel well defines the interior of the jeep and where the roll bar mounts. There is a lip you can trim off on the inside of the wheel well to gain about 1/2\" and there is body sheet metal that can be opened up. Any more is major work. The rear of the wheel well is limited by a bent panel, but there is ample room to trim body sheet metal.

My '75 CJ didn't even have a locking glove box and most locking space on newer Wranglers just uses easy to break plastic doors. It sure is nice to have a place to throw my wallet or other valuables once in a while when I don't want to carry them around. The console is great for this. I also can keep the stereo secure in the console. In the dash, it really only takes a minute or two to remove a stereo.</p> <p>The console also provides great protection from the elements for the stereo and my stuff. The weatherstripping makes it very dust and moisture resistant. I don't know how many Jeeps I've had that have had water leaks behind the dash at one time or another. Normally, that happens when the fresh air vent gets clogged with leaves and the water starts pouring in. If the radio doesn't get trashed right away, it normally is only a matter of time. Dust also kills the radios. The moving parts get jammed up with dust and you can clean it out one or two times, but after a while no amount of air or other cleaners will make them work properly again. The console, you can close up the stereo and keep it pretty sealed off from trail dust and moisture.</p> <p>Another great reason to use the stereo console is in earlier Jeeps, like my '75, the dash had no provision for a radio in it. Most people cut and drill the dash for a radio, but I didn't want to modify my dash. With the stereo console, I didn't have to ruin the dash.</p> <p>Lets not forget the arm rest. You really need to look detached and disinterested when you are driving around the coolest Jeep in town because that just makes you look cooler. The Tuffy console comes with a nice thick padded arm rest to give you that look.</p> <p>Another great reason to buy Tuffy products is they are made in the USA!</p>"},{"location":"body/tuffy03/#new-features","title":"New Features","text":"<p>It had been several years since I had worked with a Tuffy console and I was pleased to see they had made some improvements over those years.

Their \"anti-twist\" lock design looks very secure and latches the top even if the console isn't locked.</p> <p>Another minor, but nice, feature is they are now stamping \"Tuffy\" into the sheet metal of the console instead of using a sticker like they have in the past.

Installing a Tuffy console in a pre '75 Jeep is a little trickier than later Jeeps, but I'd planned for this. The tricky part is that the drivers side seat bracket goes all the way across the front to the passenger side. I'd modified the transmission tunnel making the surface under the console all flat. I'd also cut down the drivers side seat bracket and made it drop down and end as short as possible. This gave me a nice flat mounting surface and no seat bracket in the way for the console. It would be tough to mount the console in there without at least modifying the seat bracket. You could do it if you mounted the console on top of the seat belt bolts, but that didn't seem to be a good idea to me. I had enough room after the seat bracket was modified for the 8\" wide console. A wider console would require also modifying the passenger side seat bracket.</p> <p>The other odd thing about my installation is I'd increased the size of the transmission tunnel so that it was flat all underneath the console.

A great way to become unpopular is to get stuck in a big mud pit without tow hooks. Many 4x4 events require that vehicles have tow hooks to participate in trail rides. If you drive a Jeep Wrangler YJ, you'll find the common $10 hooks won't bolt on and the hooks from the dealership retail for over $60 USD. Some suppliers have started selling a less expensive hook that fits the stock holes on a Wrangler, but these hooks are not available in all areas. The high cost of OEM tow hooks and the desire to have tow hooks as well as a winch inspired Dave Moulton and Kirk Beasley to come up with this inexpensive way to mount common tow hooks on Jeep Wranglers and CJs.</p> <p></p> <p>The use of this tow hook bracket allows you to mount standard tow hooks without drilling your frame. It also allows you to easily have tow hooks even with a winch mounted up front. The angle iron can replace the 1/4\" spacer that goes between the winch plate and frame brackets. The hooks can be mounted outboard, rather than inboard like Dave's hooks.</p> <p> Here's a shot of the hook and the angle iron. The two washers are the spacers from the winch mount kit that the angle iron replaces.  From the front, you can see how the angle iron fits between the two brackets of the winch mount on Kirks's CJ.</p> <p>To add your own bracket-mounted tow hooks, you will need:</p> <ul> <li>Standard tow hooks that you should be able to purchase for around $10 with bolts.</li> <li>About 1 foot of 2 1/2\" to 3\" angle iron 1/4\" thick.</li> <li>Two 1/2\" x 1 1/2\" grade 5 bolts (angle iron to frame).</li> <li>Two 1/2\" x 2\" grade 5 bolts (angle iron to hook).</li> <li>Two 1/2\" grade 5 nuts.</li> <li>Four 1/2\" lock washers</li> <li>Fourteen 1/2\" flat washers, 7 on each side</li> <li>A saw for cutting metal, a circular saw with metal cutting blade works well.</li> <li>A drill and a 1/2\" drill bit</li> <li>Utility knife.</li> <li>Safety goggles.</li> </ul> <p>Most of the supplies you should be able to get at your local hardware store. You may be able to find the angle iron used at your local iron yard. Used iron sells around here for $0.18 a pound, so this piece should cost next to nothing.</p> <p>All that you need to do is cut the angle iron to length and drill each piece for the tow hooks on one side and for the factory tow hook mounts on the other. Dave used a 2\"x3\"x6\"x.25\" piece of angle iron with the long side up, while Kirk reports using a 2\"x2\"x5.5\"x.25\" piece of angle iron. You may need to trim the plastic cover plate away with a utility knife to expose the rear mount hole, the front hole mounts through the top bumper bolt. Use the flat washers to fill in the space under the angle iron on the rear mount hole. Bolt everything down and torque to spec.</p> <p>When you use your tow hooks, always make sure that everyone is clear.

The problem is that you then need to refill them to street pressure before you hit the highway. The obvious solution is to carry an air tank or air compressor with you on the trail. There are several ways to do this:</p> <ul> <li>Carry a pre-filled air tank with you that has enough capacity to fill all four tires. This gives you a limited air supply and doesn't allow you to help out your neighbors who need air.</li> <li>Carry a $15 compressor powered by your lighter jack. This is inexpensive and gives you unlimited air, but you have to wait forever. I have such a compressor. It's great for bikes and balls, but it only puts about 1 psi per minute into my 225/75R15's.</li> <li>If you have ARB air lockers, you can use the small compressor that powers those to fill your tires. It is better than the above option, but it's still slow, noisy, only puts out about 90 psi, and costs $200.</li> <li>Companies like Curry and Ready-Air sell electric compressors that you mount in your engine compartment. These often are set up to fill auxiliary air tanks mounted somewhere on the vehicle. The Quick Air 2 boasts 2.2 cfm at 105 psi and runs about $250.</li> <li>The York-style A/C compressors used by AMC, Ford and Volvo in the '70's can be used as engine-driven air compressors. That's the setup that I'm using on my YJ. Not only will it fill tires, but it also keeps up with most smaller air tools.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"body/york/#the-tank","title":"The Tank","text":"<p>You really should have a tank for any good onboard air setup. This ensures that you still have air if your engine dies, and it lets you run things like air tools that suck use volume than your compressor can put out.</p> <p>Some people weld shut the ends of their tube bumpers, nerf bars, or roll cages and tap a hole to mount the air fittings. For example, a 36\" long, 3\" diameter tube will hold 1.1 gallons of air. This is a great idea, if you have such things on your vehicle. I don't (yet). I opted for a used 6\"x19\", 2-gallon tank from an old portable air compressor rated at 125 psi. I picked this up at a local air compressor repair shop for $30. It even came with the necessary brackets already welded onto it, as well as two threaded holes containing a drain plug, quick disconnect fitting, and 150 psi pop-off safety valve. I just had to drill the mounting holes and cut off any brackets I didn't need.  </p> <p>The next trick is tank placement. Some people put the tank inside the vehicle, but then you have to run the air lines through the firewall to reach the compressor. It's also a safety hazard if the tank gets over-pressurized or dented and explodes. In a small vehicle like my YJ, inside space is at a premium, so I didn't want to waste it with a permanently-mounted air tank.</p> <p>That left three good spots that I could find on my YJ:</p> <ol> <li>Just behind and to the right (passenger side) of the radiator, in front of the fender well.</li> <li>Behind the right fender well, underneath the battery tray.</li> <li>Under the body tub, above, in front of, and parallel to the rear axle.</li> </ol> <p> Each spot is a different shape. The best choice depends on the shape of your tank and the amount of other stuff in your engine compartment. I chose to mount my tank by the rear axle. The maximum diameter of a tank in this position is 6\" if you want to avoid hitting it with your pinion yoke.</p> <p>When mounting your tank, it's important to have an outlet at the lowest point on the tank so you can drain moisture from it periodically. Regardless of what filters you have on the line, unless you live in a zero-humidity environment, water will condense on the inside of the tank when it depressurizes.  When I mounted my tank, I used a single hole on the bottom \"side\" of the tank for both input and output. I simply used a four-way cross connector that had the top connected to the bottom of the tank, the hose to the compressor coming out one side of the cross, a drain plug on the bottom of the cross, and a quick-disconnect fitting on the other side. The quick disconnect is a bit more difficult to reach than I'd originally envisioned, so I may drill a hole in my tub and move it inside the cab someday. To keep the inside of the quick disconnect clean, I capped off a male disconnect fitting and kept it plugged into the female end when not in use. I zip-tied the hose to the brake and fuel lines running along the inside of the frame rail and up into the engine compartment. The hose then ran along a lip on the bottom of the firewall just above the bell housing (I drilled a hole in this ledge and zip-tied the hose to it to ensure it wouldn't fall off and lie on anything hot. I coiled the extra foot or two of hose up under the battery tray, and then ran the end of it under the alternator to the front of the passenger fender well where the rest of the air fittings were located. This requires about 12' of hose; I picked up 15' of 1/4\" hose for $7 from the local surplus center.</p>"},{"location":"body/york/#the-compressor","title":"The Compressor","text":""},{"location":"body/york/#identification","title":"Identification","text":"<p>Most A/C compressors lubricate themselves with the freon that flows through the A/C system. To use these compressors for pumping air, you need to have an external oiler feeding oil into the intake hose and a filter to remove the oil from the output hose. Certain York-style compressors (the big, boxy, vertical kind) used an internal oil reservoir for lubrication, which makes them ideal for use as stand-alone air compressors. These compressors were commonly used on AMCs, Fords, and (I hear) Volvos in the '70's and early '80's.</p> <p>Therold Enterprises makes mounting brackets and alternator pulleys to mount an AMC York onto a current Jeep 4- or 6-cyl engine. The guy I talked to was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the differences in the various kinds of York compressors. He outlined three major differences in the various types: hose connectors, pulley clearance, and piston stroke length.</p> <p> Unless you have gobs of vertical hood clearance, you really want to get the AMC-style hose connectors, which run horizontally across the top of the compressor. The Ford-style connectors stick vertically out of the top of the compressors and then bend over to connect with the A/C hoses, which adds about 3\" to the total height of the unit. The good news is that these connectors are just screwed into the top of the compressor, and the two connector styles are interchangeable on the same compressor. The bad news is that the screw threads on the connectors are closer together than those on most 3/4\" pipe fittings, so it's nearly impossible to find connectors anywhere but on another York compressor. At left is a photo of my Ford-style compressor. The photo shows one Ford-style hose connector and one AMC-style connector so you can see the difference.</p> <p>Another difference between the AMC and Ford versions is the pulley. The AMC pulley is positioned very close (1/2\") to the body of the compressor. The Ford pulley sticks out about two inches away from the body. This might make a difference in your mounting bracket because the belt obviously needs to line up evenly with the pulley on the other end.</p> <p>The third difference is in the stroke length. There are reportedly three different stroke lengths, ranging from less than 7\" to over 10\". The longer the stroke, the more air the compressor can pump per minute. This doesn't vary by automaker, so there are two ways to tell which length you've got:</p> <ol> <li>If your compressor still has a metal York (not Motorcraft) ID tag bolted to the front of it, there will be a number on the tag that looks like \"F2 XXY \", where: XX | Stroke length ---|--- | 10 = long | 09 = medium | 07 = short Y | Discharge Direction | L = left | R = right</li> <li>Take off the clutch and look at the crankshaft.<ul> <li>Remove the center bolt (1/2\" socket)</li> <li>Remove the large washer</li> <li>Run a 5/8\" coarse thread bolt in until it forces the clutch off</li> <li>Look at the end of the crankshaft. The end is flat on all models.</li> <li>If the edge of the flat end is beveled, you've got the short stroke.</li> <li>If it's a sharp corner, but with a thin groove for a retaining clip, you've got the medium stroke.</li> <li>If it's a sharp corner without any groove, you've got the long stroke.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"body/york/#acquisition","title":"Acquisition","text":"<p>I've seen junkyard prices for old Yorks ranging from $12.50 to over $50. I had to pay $30 for my Ford model off a late-70's Fairmont, then shelled out another $20 to get AMC hose connectors and an idler pulley off an AMC Eagle at a different yard. If you can, have the yard personnel remove the compressor for you, since the placement of the mounting bolts makes removing it from the vehicle yourself a real PITA. When getting the hose connectors, try to grab a length of hose along with the weird connector. This will make it easier to connect it to your own custom setup later.</p> <p>Before you lay down your green, make sure the compressor works. To check whether it pumps air, plug the outlet hose with your thumb and then turn the inner portion of the clutch pulley several full revolutions. If, upon removing your thumb, you can feel the pressure difference, then it passed the test. Ideally, there should be no oil pumped out the hose, but a simple inline filter will fix that problem if it exists. The second test is whether the electric clutch works. The clutch is what locks the outer portion of the pulley where the belt runs to the inner portion of the pulley that's connected to the crankshaft. To check this, ground the compressor case on your vehicle. Then take the single wire that should be attached to the compressor and touch it to your positive battery terminal. You should hear a click as the clutch engages, and turning the outer portion of the pulley should then force the inner section to turn and pump air. When current is removed, the clutch should disengage, and the outer portion of the pulley should spin freely without moving the inner portion.</p>"},{"location":"body/york/#mounting","title":"Mounting","text":"<p>To hold oil, the compressor must be mounted vertically. The oil check/fill hole on my York is about halfway up the left (as you're facing the pulley) side of the compressor. Remove the bolt, then put a 90-degree bend in a section of metal coat hanger. Make sure it's long enough so that the end of the wire touches the bottom of the oil sump. I've seen oil level recommendations ranging from 1\" to halfway up the dipstick. The type of oil used isn't critical--regular old 10W-30 will work fine. A trigger-type oil squirter can seems to be the best way to add oil when necessary.</p> <p> Mounting the York to an old Jeep with a 258 ci inline-6 should be pretty easy, since this compressor was available from the factory. Just grab the OEM brackets from another 258 with A/C and you're good to go. Mounting it on any other engine requires fabrication of a custom mounting bracket. Complete mounting brackets for newer Jeep engines are available for $200+ from Therold Enterprises. If that's too steep for you, they'll sell you just the backplate for the compressor, with slots drilled for adjustable mounting bolts, for $12. If you're the do-it-yourself type, you could also fabricate your own design. Craig Myers has a good design for mounting to his '93 YJ 4-cyl that I believe is similar to what Therold sells. I ended up with (essentially) two 6x6x3/16\" steel plates welded together to form a T. A diagram with mounting hole measurements is on page 1. Measurements of the alternator bracket, compressor, and pulleys without the compressor bracket is on page 2.</p> <p>If your engine uses newer serpentine belts, you must somehow rig up a v-belt pulley to power the compressor's v-belt pulley. Therold sells a new alternator pulley for newer Jeeps that has both serpentine and v-belt grooves. This seems to be the route most people take, but their $40 price tag was a bit steep for me. I wandered around a junkyard until I found a pulley that would fit between my water pump pulley and the fan mount. I got one for $5 (I think it was from an '80-ish Chevy Caprice -- I forget exactly) that had 3 screw holes (my Jeep has four) and a 7/8\" center shaft hole (my Jeep's was 5/8\"). I took it to a local machinist who charged me $15 to narrow the center hole with a washer and drill a 4-hole bolt pattern to match that of my Jeep. I considered doing it myself, but a pulley spinning at 4K rpm will cause nasty vibrations and eventually tear up your water pump if it's not perfectly centered. My route was a bit more work, but I saved $20. The result required a 49.5\" v-belt. The center of the belt has at least an inch of play when I push hard, which is more than I'd like, but a 49\" belt just wasn't long enough. An idler pulley may be in order if belt slippage becomes a problem.</p> <p>The first picture below shows the pulley as it came off the donor vehicle. The second picture shows the modifications that the machinist made to allow mounting to my YJ. The third photo shows it mounted in place.  </p> <p>If I were doing it again, I might just buy the stuff from Therold rather than fabbing it myself. Their way uses a $40 pulley plus a $12 plate that allows the compressor to adjust itself vertically, guaranteeing a tight belt ($52 total). My set cost $20 for the re-machined pulley plus $40 for the bracket (got screwed there--he quoted me $25 initially). This cost $60 total, and I may have to add a sturdy, adjustable idler pulley to my compressor bracket if the belt turns out to be too loose.</p>"},{"location":"body/york/#air-fittings","title":"Air Fittings","text":"<p>I chose to mount the hose connectors and stuff on the inside of my front right wheel well near the factory jack. That location provides easy access and also keeps everything above the water line should I decide to ford any rivers.  </p> <p>The input hose on the York compressor needs to run to an air filter. I used a $4 crankcase filter (Fram part BA3631) that looked like it would match up well to my intake hose. A foot or so of electrical tape fastened it to the metal part of the intake hose connector.</p> <p>If your compressor leaks any oil out through the output hose, you'll want to install an inline air filter between the compressor and the rest of the system. This should trap any oil, water, or anything else that you don't want getting blown into your tank, tires, or tools. It doesn't look like my compressor has this problem, so I opted to save $20 and skip the filter.</p> <p>The output hose from the York (or the filter, if so equipped) needs to run to a check valve that prevents air from the rest of the system from flowing back into the compressor. If this were allowed to happen, the compressor would have to work much harder to start up initially.</p> <p>On the system side of the check valve, I installed a pressure switch. This switch turns the compressor's clutch on when the pressure in the system drops to a certain level, and turns it off again when the pressure climbs to a certain level. Many pressure switches have preset on and off levels, but I found one at a surplus center for $17 that has variable settings I can adjust myself. The difference between on and off is present to about 15-20 psi. I adjusted the turn on pressure to about 90-95 psi for now, putting the shut off pressure at just under 110 psi. If you're using this compressor to power your ARB air lockers, you must keep the pressure between 80 and 105 psi.</p> <p>Next to the pressure switch, I installed a 160 psi pressure gauge. Make sure you mount this such that it will be easily visible in less than optimal lighting without sticking your head down into a running engine. Mine ended up just rearward of the right headlight, lying sideways and facing straight up.</p> <p>Somewhere around here needs to be a pop-off safety valve rated the same as your wimpiest piece of hardware. In my case, the 125 psi tank was the limiting factor. If the pressure reaches a certain level, this valve will pop open to release the extra pressure before something more critical explodes.</p> <p>The last piece was a 1/4\" NPT quick-disconnect fitting to which I can attach the air hose of my choosing. I picked up a 25' long 1/4\" rubber air hose at the local surplus center for $7. (The spring-coiled hoses just don't stretch far enough to reach all four tires.) One end of the hose needs a male fitting for the quick disconnect, and the other end needs a female end. Remember to get an air chuck to attach the hose to your tire stems. If you tend to splash water, mud, or other crud around your engine compartment (or near the rear axle, where I mounted a second quick disconnect), then you'll want to keep that stuff out of your air fittings. I got two mail quick disconnect fittings and capped them off to use as plugs in the female fittings when I'm not using the air system for more important things.</p> <p>This whole mess is attached to my fender well with an angle bracket and a couple bolts.</p>"},{"location":"body/york/#electrical-connections","title":"Electrical Connections","text":"<p>In addition to the pressure switch, you should also have a main switch somewhere in the battery / pressure switch / clutch circuit so that your battery doesn't go dead if your tank gets low while the engine isn't running. A lighted switch run through the firewall to your dashboard is probably a good idea.</p> <p>I used a big, lighted SPST rocker switch screwed to an angle bracket on the bottom of my dash (just under the climate control levers). Being lighted, it is straightforward to see at a glance whether it's on or off, but at night, that bright red light is quite blinding. I recommend getting a smallish switch whose glow won't ward off oncoming aircraft.</p> <p>The wire ran from the upper-left-most accessory plug in my under-dash fuse block to the rocker switch. I used an accessory plug so that the circuit would be switched by the ignition key; there's obviously no point in engaging the compressor clutch if the fan belts aren't turning. It then ran from the switch through the rubber grommet above the accelerator through which all the other dash wires run into the engine compartment. Use a small knife to cut the smallest slit possible in the rubber grommet that will still allow your wire to pass through. The wire then ran along the front of the firewall to the passenger side fender well and then up to the pressure switch.

The sponge disintegrates with the repeated full charge and discharge chemical reactions. Lead particles separate from the plates and form micro-short circuits inside the battery. This highly increases the self-discharge rate. Maintenance-free batteries have added calcium to the lead sponges to harden them and reduce water loss.

There are very few true deep cycle batteries with greater than 6 volts, as they would be too heavy to move by hand. The grids are over 4 times thicker than a starting battery's grids. And there is several times the amount of antimony in the grids. The plates are thick to add lifetime, not capacity. The plates are not constructed of sponge, but of scored sheets of lead with up to 16% antimony. The thickness of the plates combined with the high antimony content lowers the energy density, so this battery is heavier, larger and much more costly per kilowatt-hour. The case is also much thicker, and the plates usually leave a 1-3 inch space at the bottom to allow for accumulation of lead particles, so that they don't cause micro-shorts. The top of the case also has more space to allow for expansion of the electrolyte. Plates can be removed and serviced. As the cell interconnect straps are exposed, each cell's voltage can be measured individually. This allows the user to determine when an equalizing charge is necessary. Some batteries have \"wrapped\" plates, where perforated plastic is wrapped around the plates to keep the lead on them longer. Such a configuration add 25-35% to the lifetime of the battery.

This will probably not happen too often because batteries have awful thermal conductivity so they never reach the ambient temperature unless of course you live in Alaska and leave it parked on a glacier the entire winter!! The other interesting thing about batteries is that at lower temperatures there is increased internal resistance. If you leave something small plugged in (like a radar detector) it will draw current.

So much so that I'll bet most of you engineer to overkill. What are the issues you need to be concerned about?</p> <p>1. Use the smallest reasonable wire size for the required current.</p> <ul> <li>Wire is expensive and the larger you go, the more expensive it is.</li> <li>Wire is heavy and the larger you go, the heavier it gets.</li> <li>Mechanically, smaller wire is easier to route, easier to protect, easier to fit connectors on. Therefore it is more reliable mechanically - up to a pratical limit - see below.</li> </ul> <p>2. Use a large enough wire so there is no voltage drop. We want whatever it is we are wiring to operate at top efficiency.</p> <p>3. Maintain an adequate safety margin. We don't want to melt any wires.</p> <p>The first thing you have to do is determine the current you have to carry. For DC circuits, that's relatively easy. Some equipment on a car is rated directly in current draw. Auxiliary fans, fuel pumps and things like that are rated in current draw - Amps. Some equipment is rated in Watts - mostly the lighting equipment. The power requirement in Watts will be printed right on the bulb or stamped in the base. To come up with amps use one of the formulas shown.</p> <p>Let's calculate for a typical 100 Watt Driving Light - the power required is 100 Watts and the voltage is 12 Volts - so the current requirement is 100 Watts/12 Volts = 8.33 Amps. Let's assume you have to run a wire 6 feet from a relay to the lamp and look at the chart on the next page. Using the 10 Amp column you'll find that you can run 10 Amps on 15 feet of 18 AWG with only \u00bd Volt drop. Go to the next size larger for safety margin and you're at 16 AWG. Now in reality, you have to balance the mathematical results with mechanical reliability and efficiency. For lighting, the rated output is figured at 13.5 volts, not 12 volts. With the 0.5 volt drop shown in the chart, you have 13.0 volts available at the lamp - and at that 95% rated voltage, you are only going to get 80% of the rated output - or the equivalent of 80 watts from a 100 watt lamp. In our example, I'd go to 14 AWG as the wire and connectors are physically stronger, easier to work with, and there's no voltage drop - plus I only buy three sizes - 14, 12 and 10 AWG. Those three and crimp-on connectors are readily available just about anywhere. And except for primary circuits , those three sizes will cover just about anything you want to wire in a car with an adequate safety margin.</p> <p>Is your Alternator big enough for all your electrical equipment? Each 100 watt lamp is going to draw about 9 amps so six of them is going to suck up about 55 Amps. The other accessories on your car - cooling fan, heater fan, ignition, fuel pump, running lights, etc. - are going to draw roughly another 30-40 Amps - your total power requirement will reach about 90-100 Amps.</p> <p>It's impossible to compensate for a small alternator by throwing in a bigger battery as the battery will just be drained and the voltage will suffer, affecting your light output and overall performance. Your best solution is to go to a modern, high output alternator of at least 100 Amps or more. If you are really worried about weight, you're better off with a smaller battery. All it really has to do is start the engine if the alternator is large enough to carry the rest of the load after the car is running.</p>"},{"location":"electrical/#maximum-current-load-in-amps-12-volts-dc","title":"Maximum Current load in AMPS @ 12 Volts DC","text":"<p>Wire gauge in AWG vs wire length in feet</p> Gauge 1' 2' 4' 6' 8' 10' 20g 106 53 26 17 13 8 18g 150 75 37 25 18 15 16g 224 112 56 37 28 22 14g 362 181 90 60 45 36 12g 572 286 143 95 71 57 10g 908 454 227 151 113 90 8g 1452 726 363 241 181 145 6g 2342 1171 585 390 292 234 4g 3702 1851 925 616 462 370 2g 6060 3030 1515 1009 757 606 1g 7692 3846 1923 1280 961 769 0g 9708 4854 2427 1616 1213 970"},{"location":"electrical/#maximum-current-load-in-amps-12-volts-dc_1","title":"Maximum Current load in AMPS @ 12 Volts DC","text":"<p>Wire gauge vs. maximum current by length (feet)</p> 12' 15' 20' 50' 100' 200' 20g 18g 12 16g 18 14 14g 30 24 18 12g 47 38 28 10g 75 60 45 8g 120 96 72 29 6g 194 155 117 46 23 4g 307 246 185 74 37 2g 503 403 303 121 60 30 1g 638 511 384 153 76 38 0g 805 645 485 194 97 48 <p>Calculate the current load and find the next highest on the top row.

The engine harness comes out on the drivers side corner.</p> <p>Wiring up a Willys CJ-2A is no simple matter. I had two stock wiring harnesses and both were beyond recovery. The cloth insulation on the wires just doesn't last 50 years or more. I recently parted out a rolled '77 CJ-7, so I decided to use the wiring harness from the CJ-7 on the Willys. It worked pretty well and saved lots of time and money.</p>"},{"location":"electrical/pieces01/#engine","title":"Engine","text":"<p>The most difficult part of the wiring was placing the fuse block. For everything to lay out right, it had to be on the drivers side, but there is a lot less room on a flat fender than there is on a CJ-7. I managed to squeeze it in on the far lower corner of the fire wall. There was just enough room to be able to unplug the engine side of the harness and I used the stock CJ-7 screws to attach the fuse block.</p> <p>The wiring of the Buick 231 V6 could not be easier. The harness I had was from a 258 equipped CJ-7 that did not have a computer controlled carburetor, so it was pretty simple as well. Most of the wires in the harness, I didn't use. The two big red wires were hooked up to the hot to provide juice for the interior. The starter wire was hooked directly to the starter. Later, I hooked the starter wire to a relay that provided better power to the starter and this helped hot starts quite a bit. A hot on run wire was hooked up to another relay that went to the big cap HEI. That was all that was required to get rolling. There were a bunch of other wires for gauges, but I never bothered to hook them up. It would have best if I took all the various sending units off the 258 and put them on the 231, but I didn't do that, so that discouraged me from hooking up the gauges.</p> <p>On the passenger side of the engine compartment, I don't have a battery, the battery is in the back. I wanted a little power center where all the power would be sourced from, so I put that on the passenger side. I bought a heavy duty switch and terminal from Wrangler Power Products. The wires come up from the batteries and everything sources power from this point. I can turn off all the power using the switch that is accessible from behind the dash. The winch, I wired on the always hot side of the switch so that the winch didn't have to pull power through the switch. Technically, the winch can draw more than the switch can handle although I've run winches through wimpier looking switches.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> A power center lives on the passenger side of the fire wall with a heavy duty cut off switch.  The fuse box is located near the floor on the drivers side. The high beams switch is just below it.  Inset tail and backup lights where mounted where mounted in the diamond plate corners.

I patched what I could and built a dash that I could remove easily to diagnose problems. I installed in it all the gauges from the '77 CJ-7.

I extended the harness to provide lights for the vacuum and transmission temperature gauges.</p> <p>The volt meter and the vacuum gauge work great! The rest, well it didn't seem so important once I was driving. The fuel sending unit from the flat fender did not seem to work with the CJ-7 gauge. I never wired up the oil pressure, transmission temperature, or engine temperature gauges, they look cool though. I always figured if the engine oil pressure was low, I would hear the lifters. If the engine was hot, steam would come out. The transmission never got that hot, I have always been able to touch the transmission coolers with no discomfort.</p> <p>The CJ-7 had convenience lights under the dash which I wired up and they work. I also put a big dome light on the roll bar which is much better. The CB also lives on the roll bar. The switches for the lights and the wipers were put on the left of the steering column for space reasons. A steering column from a '77 Cherokee was used and the CJ-7 harness plugged right into it. That provides the ignition switch and blinkers.

The front parking lights I wired up as turn signal indicators only. They were originally parking lights only, but I felt it would be more useful to have turn signals up front. Most CJ-2As came from the factor with a single brake light and a reflector. I wired up two inset lights for brake and turn in the back using the stock CJ-7 harness. My transmission didn't have a switch for backup lights, so I just wired up a switch for backup lights that I put under the dash.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The parking lights on the grill were converted to turn singals for safety.

The most common problem I see with the engine is it's inability to idle. Between the 258 in my '81 CJ-7 and a couple friends that have 258 equipped Wranglers, I have fixed this problem half a dozen times and the cause of the problem has always been the same. The problem has always been caused by clogged idle tubes that cause fuel to drip out of the venturis and make the Jeep run rich at idle. Fixing the problem is relatively easy and once you get past this problem, you will get much more enjoyment from the 258 and the Carter BBD carburetor.</p> <p>The Carter BBD is a two barrel carburetor that was available on late 70s to late 80s Jeeps with the 4.2L engine.

In advanced cases, the Jeep will stall at every stop sign and will only run at high RPMs. Gas mileage will suffer since fuel will just be sloshing out at idle. Sometimes the idle will be turned up to a high RPM to avoid the problem. Typically, the Jeep will run fine at higher RPMs (unless there are also other problems.)</p> <p>For a sure diagnosis, park the Jeep with the engine off and remove the air cleaner cover. There should be a plate over the throat of the carb, the choke plate. If you open the choke plate you should be able to see down the throat of the carb and you should see two screws with holes in the middle of them. Next to them are two passages with a nozzle in the middle of each. This thing is known as the venturi, when air passes by, fuel is supposed to be drawn out through the nozzles. If the idle tubes are clogged fuel will drip from those nozzles during idle.</p> <p>In order to see if fuel drips from the nozzles at idle, you must start your Jeep with the air cleaner cover off and look down the throat of the carb. The Jeep Technical Service Manual recommends that, when you do this, you cover the air cleaner with a piece of plexiglass since the engine can backfire through the carb and a flame can shoot out. Since I am reckless and like living dangerously, I never do this.</p> <p>After you have chosen the wise or foolish path, start your Jeep and open the choke plate. If your idle tubes are badly clogged, you will see fuel dripping from the nozzles at idle (if your Jeep will idle at all.) If you don't see fuel dripping, but your idle is still poor, open the throttle a bit with your hand or have a friend hit the accelerator. You should see two even streams of fuel and no dripping from the nozzles. Any dripping means clogged idle tubes.</p> <p>While you are doing this, make sure you don't put your hand or anything else into rotating parts like the fan.

Be careful not to drop the screws down the manifold unless you enjoy fishing. Remove the choke plate.</li> <li>If your carb has one, remove the plate on the side that covers the choke linkage so you can access the screw holding the choke rod. It may be necessary to drill out a rivet to get it free.</li> <li>Remove the little snap ring and screw (1/4\" socket) that holds the rod that holds the choke plate and remove the rod. A screw driver will normally push off the snap ring.</li> <li>Remove the two screws with holes in the middle of them and carefully remove the venturi cluster with the two little gaskets. There should be two idle pickup tubes pushed into the venturi sticking out of the bottom. If they have fallen out, that could cause your idle problem.</li> <li>Blast the venturi and inside of carb with lots of carb cleaner. Be sure not to dislodge the check ball in the center.</li> <li>With a long thin pin or piece of piano wire, make sure the idle tubes and nozzles are clear. After you have run them through, spray with more carb cleaner.</li> <li>Put the cleaned out venturi cluster back with the two gaskets and two screws.</li> <li>Replace the choke rod with snap ring and screw and replace the choke plate. Make sure all the screws are tight that hold together the carb body at this time. Often the screws will loosen up and dirt will be sucked into the carb.</li> <li>Replace the plate covering the choke linkage with a sheet metal screw, or leave it off.</li> <li>Replace the air cleaner.</li> </ol> <p>Smooth idle should have returned after this simple process. If you still have idle problems and don't have any dripping, make sure all the vacuum hoses are hooked up and in good shape.

This will greatly reduce the frequency of clogging and it is a procedure that was actually recommended by Jeep for a while.</p> <p>An alternative to removing the choke plate and all is to just remove the top of the carburetor. The advantage of this approach is you can make sure there isn't a lot of junk in the bowls, you can check your float adjustment, etc. It also may help if you have power brakes because the master cylinder may be in the way of getting the choke rod out.</p>"},{"location":"engine/upgrades/convbuickv6/","title":"Swapping a Buick V6 Into Your Jeep","text":"<p> by Terry Howe</p> <p>Consider the Buick V6, it is short, plentiful, and powerful.

I am now legally\nblind. :-).\nIn a talk with Norton Young a week or 2 ago, he told me\nthat by 1961, the folks in the corner offices at K-F\nhad no more interest in these statistics so he quit\nkeeping them. He also said that he had difficulty\ngetting \"timely\" reports from the production people,\nand often had to go thru the unit sheets himself and\ntry to piece the info together. He admitted that there\nmay be some errors.\nList #12 is the worst one for errors, there being 6412\nmore units produced, according to the serial numbers,\nthan show on the original sheets. For this one sheet\nI show the corrected numbers. For instance, 6-226 4WD\n55268, shows only 255 units produced, but serial\nnumbers indicate 7747 units. Based on 1960 figures,\n7747 seems to be correct. Also, 475 2x4 Mav. 58147\nshows only 202 units on original, understated by\n1000.\nTodd, I give up. What is an El Goucho??\nI also don't know what a \"CPC\" is, or an \"AVA\".\nIf anyone runs across an inconsistency - and if you\ndon't it will be a miracle - please post it to the\nlist so we can check it out.\n\n***\nCharlie \"SleeveValve\" Weaver, Winston-Salem, NC\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"models/cj-2a/","title":"CJ-2A","text":"<p>The CJ-2A was the first civilian Jeep.

The CJ-7 is basically a stretched CJ-5. An extra 10\" was added behind the front seats to make the CJ-7 a 91\" wheelbase vehicle vs. the CJ-5s 81\". The extra 10\" allowed AMC to offer an automatic transmission for the first time in a CJ. A CJ-7 tub can be identified by the shape of the door opening, the opening is square, where as the CJ-5 has a curving door opening. The Wrangler (YJ) tub has the same dimensions as the CJ-7 and can be used on a CJ-7 with some modifications.</p> <p>The CJ-7 also was available with a hard top and doors from the factory. Hard tops and doors were available for earlier models, but not from the factory.</p> <p>A new fully boxed frame was available for CJs from '76-'86 and although the welds are ugly, the frame is stronger than frames used in previous CJs. The frame was widened in the rear and the springs were moved farther out to make the CJs more stable on the road, unfortunately this mildly reduces the articulation of the rear axle. Other features such as sway bars and steering stabilizers were added around this time to increase handling. Another change in 1982 was made to make the CJs more stable, wider axles were used. There are some differences in shock mounting, but \"wide track\" axles are compatible with '76-'81 \"narrow track\" CJs and visa-versa.</p> <p>1980 marked the end of the Great Transmission Era.

The extra room in the CJ-6 will make this a great drive to the trail head and camp all weekend rig. It is not being built to wheel extreme trails every weekend without failure, some compromises are going to be made for street and comfort.</p> <p>Many of the parts originally on Project Deep Six will be sold off and replaced with newer and stronger parts, the old parts will be deep sixed. The idea behind this project, and any project I build for that matter, is to build a high performance Jeep without deep pockets. I'm cheap, but I want performance, so half the battle is finding good parts that don't cost much rather than just breaking out the credit card.</p> <p>When I bought the Jeep, it had a 232 I6 engine, T-14 3 speed transmission, and a Dana 20 transfer case. The stock axles were a Dana 30 front and Dana 44 rear with tapered shafts with open diffs and 3.73 gears. I was having trouble getting the 232 to pass emissions and I had a 258 I6, T-18 4 speed, and Dana 300 transfer case combination sitting on my garage floor from my old CJ-7 I decided to start by swapping all that in since I knew I could get the 258 to pass emissions, which I did. I also purchased a used 2.5\" lift kit from my friend Roger Wild so that I could fit the 33\"x12.5\" BFG MTs that I also had from my CJ-7.</p> <p>So, that is where it stands now, lifted with open diffs and relatively low gears. It can do some relatively hard trails like this, but nothing extreme. The hardest trail I've been on with it so far with it is Hackett Gulch.</p> <p>It is real nice as it stands, I drive to work in it every day and wheel it occasionally. The tub has a lot of rust holes in it though and the frame has excessive frame flex that cause the clutch to bind up. The tub needs a lot of body work in general and a stiffer frame and better suspension are in order. I also need to get rid of the hard top and get a soft top! Well, the list goes on, I have a lot of interesting plans in the works.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"projects/deep6/#deep-six-gets-an-8274","title":"Deep Six Gets an 8274","text":"<p>Predator Four Wheel Drive was running a special on some brand new, old style Warn 8274 winches.

I had the original wiring harness from the '89 Firebird, but there were a couple problems with it. The Fireturd harness was slightly damaged from a leaky exhaust and it was a MAF (mass air flow) engine and I didn't really have room to run the MAF sensor. I wanted to run a speed density engine with the MAP (manifold absolute pressure). The MAP engine is just a neater package, you can just slap a cone filter on the air intake.</p> <p>On my flat fender, I had a '77 CJ-7 wiring harness and I spliced that in with a '90 S-10 harness for a 4.3L engine.

A good section of the hood, half of the cowl, and one fender were having problems as well as a part of the dash and grill.</p> <p>Monday, I sanded everything down and wet sanded everything again. This time, I was sure to wipe everything with clean rags and use a prep solvent to wipe it down. I shot a couple coats of color over many sections to get everything to lay down nicely.

The only sag I got was when I had the gun set for a horizontal fan and I was thinking I was shooting a vertical fan.</p> <p>Sean stopped by around 6pm after his day of work and shot the clear for me. I wanted him to shoot the clear since he has a way better technique than I have. The clear came out awesome except one spot where some foreign material shot out of the gun. Not sure where it came from, must of been some junk fell in the mixing cup. I need to sand it out and reshoot the cowl with clear only.</p> <p>Other than that small problem, the rig looks great!

One problem was one of the brackets was broken off on the bottom and the other problem was I needed a return for my heater hose and the raidator did not have a provision for this. Normally, I'd just go to the radiator shop and get this taken care of, but I was a little low on dough, so I decided to give it a shot myself.</p> <p>I got out my tourch, some solder I used for sweating copper pipe, and some flux. I put a bunch of flux on the bracket and heated it up with the tourch and melted the solder into it. I clamped the bracket to the radiator with some vice grips.

It is not pretty, but it should work.</p> <p>The engine block didn't have a provision for a return for the heater hose. On the donor car, the heater hose returned to the main return hose or the radiator, I don't recall exactly.

I used a stepper bit to drill a hole in the radiator.</p> <p>I hooked up the heater hoses and searched my box of radiator hoses for the other hoses. I found a GM hose with number 15561135GBS that fit just great as the lower hose. I don't remember if this hose was out of the Fireturd or some other car.</p> <p>I didn't have anything that worked for the top hose, so I went to the auto parts store with a tape measure and got them to let me in the hose department.

One the bottom of the fuel tank is a skid plate made of 14g diamone plate.  With the top welded on, there is just a small access hole to get to the fuel pump and the sending unit.</p> <p>It is hard to find a 20 gallon fuel tank for an early CJ. The frame rails are close together, so you cannot use later gas tanks, you cannot even use the later 15 gallon tanks. The 15 gallon tank that came with my Jeep leaked, so I needed to do something. I decided to make my own tank and my advice to anyone that comes to this same conclusion would be don't do it! The reason I would advise against making your own fuel tank is it is hard to make it leak proof, it is very time consuming, and it is potentially dangerous.</p> <p>Part of the reason my tank was hard to make leak proof was it was too big to make out of one sheet of sheet metal and my original plan did not work quite right. I had extra seams that wouldn't be necessary on another tank. When I first bent my tank, it turned out too big and didn't provide enough clearance with the leaf springs. I had to cut it down and create a seam where I should of had a bend. I used the \"hillbilly\" brake to bend the metal. I just clamped a piece of angle iron down where I wanted the bend and pushed the metal by hand. I finished off the bend by hitting it with a rubber mallet.</p> <p>I tested the tank, by pressurizing it with 20psi of air from my air compressor. This could be potentially dangerous if the tank blows up, but I got lucky. I put soapy water on the tank to find air holes, dried them off, depressurized the tank, and welded them up. It took me nearly all afternoon to find and stop them all up. The welds are ugly, but it seems to hold. There are no leaks that I know of yet.</p> <p>The other reason I would recommend against making your own tank is it is time consuming. I have this unit as one day, but I have a long 2 days at least in this project, probably closer to 3 days. Part of the reason for that is my original plan had to be modified, but even then, setting up the fuel pump, sending unit, baffles, fill hole, access hole, ... took a lot of time.</p> <p>The other reason I would recommend against building your own fuel tank is it is potentially dangerous. You need to run wires through the tank. You need at least a sending unit wire and maybe a wire for your fuel pump. If anything goes wrong, your fuel tank may blow up. Comforting thought.</p> <p>The end result is not pretty, but I think it will be functional. Mathematically, the tank should hold 24 gallons or so. From experience with other aftermarket tanks, I expect to get 22 gallons or less of fuel in it. To calculate the number of gallons of gas I expect the tank to hold, I just divided the volume by 231. An easy number to remember if you are familiar with the 231 Buick V6, the gallon engine. My fuel tank was 25\"x15\"x16\" and with a few gallons taken off for tapered sections of the tank, I got 24 gallons.</p> <p>I was able to use the extra space provided by a 2\" body lift to move the tank up higher and the clearance isn't bad. The tank is built mostly from 14g cold rolled steel and it has a 14g skid plate welded on the bottom. It should take some abuse.</p>"},{"location":"projects/deep6/day21/","title":"Deep CJ-6: Day Twenty-one Getting it Running*Short Cuts","text":"<p>By: Terry L.

I probably could of run a thinner wall tube for the dash bar and rear cross braces, but it was easier just to use all 120 wall. I definitely wanted the 120 wall for the main hoops and upper cross bars since 120 wall resists denting a lot better than thinner tube.</p> <p>Other than the three sticks of DOM tube, I used two six inch pieces of 3/4\" 0.060 wall HREW for gussets behind the front seats. I also used six 3\"x3\"x3/16\" pieces of flat stock for foot plates. I cut them out of a length of 3\"x3/16\" flat. I bought twenty-four 3/8\"x1\" grade 5 bolts, some fender washers, and stop nuts to bolt it down.</p>"},{"location":"projects/deep6/day23/#construction","title":"Construction","text":"<p>The first step in building this cage was the hardest, it was building the main hoop. Most factory cages are built making a hoop from side to side behind the front seats. I wanted to run two hoops from front to back to increase usable room in the passenger compartment. I also wanted to square off the back of the Jeep like later Wranglers to provide more protection for passengers.</p> <p>Using my JD2 bender with 1.75\"x6.5\" die, I started a 15 degree bend at 31\". At 40\", I did another 75 degree bend to complete the 90 degrees. I did a third bend that ended up to be about another 75 degree bend at 87\". The result is a little squarer than I wanted in the back, but pretty darn close.</p> <p>After the two main hoops were bent, I cut and drilled the six foot plates. When the foot plates were made, I took four of them and welded them to the bottom of the main hoops. The foot plates allowed me to drill and bolt in the two main hoops.</p> <p>With the main hoops bolted in, I was able to measure for the three cross members and the dash bar. I cut all of these the same length and fish mouthed the ends with my fish mouth jig. I also made the main upright bars that go behind the front seats.</p> <p>After all the new crossbars were deburred and cleaned up, I tack welded them all in place. I welded the two foot plates to the upright bars and tacked them in place as well.</p> <p>Before pulling the cage, I made two more bars to run from the top of the upright bar to the bottom of the rear of the main hoops. This triangulates the cage front to back.</p> <p>It would be much stronger to triangulate the cage in the other direction as well, but that is a compromise in space and convenience. I wanted some extra strength in that direction, so I used some 6\" long sections of 3/4\"x0.060\" HREW to make gussets in the other direction. These little gussets add a lot of strength and they are convenient to loop a strap through.</p> <p>I also drilled some holes and welded in tube on the main upright bars so that I could run a three point seat belt in the future. Right now I only have lap belts, but I would like to run the three point belts in the future. I used the 3/4\" HREW for sleeve the seat belt bolt hole. It would be been nicer to use a thicker tube to sleeve the bolt hole, but that is all I had.</p> <p>After it was all tacked together, I pulled the cage and welded it out.

Howe - 2/2000</p> <p> From the back, you can see the 2\"x2\" angle that secures the leading edge.  The battery tray from above. You can see the holes that attach the leading edge and the angle iron around the bottom of the batteries.  Dual optimas securely fastened down in the new battery tray. Some flat black paint is the finishing touch.</p> <p>It is always a challenge fitting things into a flat fender; fitting a dual battery system into Project Pieces &amp; Parts was no exception. The original location for the battery on CJ-2As is on the passenger side fender. This works fine with the 134 I4 \"Go Devil\" engine, but it gets pretty tight with a V8 or V6 engine. I also wanted to cut out the fenders as much as possible to keep the engine cool, so I didn't want to mount the battery or batteries on the fenders. The military Willys' have an extra battery under the cowl (behind the passenger side dash), but I wanted to put a heater in this area. I finally decided behind the rear axle would be the best place for the batteries.</p> <p>Obviously, if the batteries were going behind the rear axle, they would need some protection. I got out the tape measure and discovered a CJ-7 gas tank skid plate would fit back there and, with some chopping, be level with the bottom of the rear bumper. This area is normally occupied by a brace for a PTO output. A lot of people will cut out the brace and install a 15 gallon early 70s CJ gas tank in this spot. I was going with two gas tanks under the seats, so this space was free.</p> <p>I started prepping the CJ-7 gas tank skid plate by hitting it with a wire brush to remove the grime and rust. I cut off the trailing edge and drilled holes for my shackle bracket. The trailing edge attaches flush with the rear bumper, and is held on by the bolts of the shackle bracket. On the leading edge, I used a 2\"x2\"x1/8\" piece of angle iron. I cut it to length and welded it to the frame rails and drilled it out for the holes in the leading edge of the CJ-7 gas tank skid plate.</p> <p>I needed to hold the batteries in place, so I fabricated my own dual battery tray. I used some 1\"x1\"x1/8\" angle and cut four pieces just large enough for the bottom of the two batteries. To hold the batteries down, I used a piece of 1\"x1/8\" C-channel and some 5/16\" threaded rod. The C-channel goes across the top, and the threaded rod goes down to the angle iron around the bottom.</p> <p>Wait a minute! How do you get to your batteries you ask? Since I had to replace the floor in the rear, I built a little trap door in the floor. I used a piano hinge on it and two little cabinet roller latches to hold it closed. For a handle, I used the little D-ring that used to be on the tool box under the passenger seat.</p> <p>To get power up to the engine, I went to my local welding supply store and had two long cables made up to run the power from the batteries up to the firewall. On the fire wall, I have a terminal stud and a battery disconnect switch that I purchased from Wrangler Power Products. I run the power for the whole Jeep through the switch except for the winch. The reason I didn't run the winch through the switch is because it can exceed the specification for the switch.</p> <p>The Wrangler Power Products catalog had a chart for selecting wire gauge size based on amperage and length of cable. According to the chart and the max pull from my winch, I needed 2/0 cable. This cable seemed excessive to me, but I went with it anyway. I needed two 20 foot sections of cable to go from the back to the firewall on the passenger side.</p> <p>Since the cables were so long and they ran right along the frame rail, I decided it would be best to provide some protection for them. A piece of regular electrical conduit was purchased at my local Home Despot to run the cables through. I used my tubing bender to bend the conduit so the cables wouldn't enter and exit the conduit at sharp angles. The conduit should greatly reduce the risk of a short.</p> <p>The terminals for the switch are on the engine side of the firewall and the lever for the switch is on the passenger compartment side of the firewall. Since the switch is up behind the dash, I also can use it to a kill switch to turn off all power to the Jeep for security.</p>"},{"location":"projects/pieces/body/","title":"Project Pieces and Parts - Body Work","text":"<p>by: Terry L.

Since I didn't have a brake, I used some 1\"x1\" angle iron to join the sheet metal in some places.</p> <p>I used some 1\"x3\" square tubing to make body mounts on the bottom of the tub. It was easy to drill this material out from the top with a hole saw and weld in a captured nut. After the nut was welded in, I welded the square tubing to the bottom of the new floor. After the floors were replaced and the body mounts welded on, I had the tub sand blasted to remove all the old paint and Bondo. The sand blasting exposed a lot of problems, but it sure made welding easy. A few patches were welded on the sides and on the rear fender wells. The passenger side needed a lot of hammering since it had obviously been hit in some accident.</p> <p>There were a couple modifications I did to the tub since I was replacing a lot of metal anyway. One modification was to eliminate the tool box and add a filler hole for an extra gas tank under the passenger seat. The gas tank under the drivers seat only holds around 11 gallons of fuel, so with two tanks, I should have plenty of fuel for long drives.</p> <p>Another modification I did was move the front of the rear fender back about 1\".

Howe</p> <p> Test fitting the tub, hood, and grill  Cutting off back of frame  Cross member cut off  Frame welded together outside view  The bumper</p> <p>The frame on Project Pieces and Parts is probably the most radical work so far. The original frame I got with this Willys was from a '50 CJ-3A and it was badly bent and had numerous welds on it. The rear section was rusted clear through in places. I decided there was no saving it, but kept it just in case.</p> <p>I happened to stumble across a '73 Commando for next to nothing that was missing the engine and suffered severe fire damage to the interior. I took it apart and sold some and saved some, the brakes I used for the rear axle on Pieces and Parts. The frame was left over and it was in great shape and boxed almost all the way. Obviously, it was too long for a flat fender, but after some measuring, I determined I could use it if I took about 25\" out of middle and 8\" off the back. I started cutting.</p> <p>The back end was the easy part, I just cut off about 8\" with a circular hand saw. The remaining rear part of the frame turned out to be the same dimensions as the original frame. The Commando uses a spring that was shorter in the front than it is in the back, so the resulting axle position ended being the same. I left the axle bump stop and shock mount where it was. I bolted on the front spring hanger from the original frame on the front and welded it on as well. Originally, it was riveted and welded on. On the rear, I used the cut down shackle hanger from a CJ-7 bolted on.</p> <p>The Commando has the springs mounted outside of the frame rails, and the shackle hanger was built into the rear cross member. It wasn't worth reusing the original crossmember, so I built my own out of some 4x4x1/4\" angle. I happened to pick up a scrap of this cheap at the scrap yard. Since it was heavy gauge, I built a combination cross member and rear bumper. I cut the sides at angles and welded a tab on the back to tie it into the same bolt that attaches the shackle hanger to the frame. Two 1/2\" bolts attach it to the top of the frame and two 1/2\" bolts go through the bottom of the frame and the shackle hanger. I bolted a shackle hanger to the middle for recovery.</p> <p>After the rear cross member was squared away, I was ready to chop out the middle to get the proper length. On the inside channel, I was able to cut the channel where it tied into a cross member in from of the axle. This welded back together very clean and looks stock.</p> <p>The outside channel was cut further toward the middle so that both joints wouldn't be in the same place and it was butt welded together. Once the body is ready to go on, I'll need to weld back on all the body mounts that were cut off. At this time I'll weld on a plate over this cut. Straight vertical welds on frames are said to be prone to cracking, but a fish mouthed plate welded over the cut will distribute the stress horizontally.</p> <p>The front bumper is minimalist to the extreme. I cut a piece from the same 4\"x4\"x1/4\" angle that I used to fabricate the rear bumper. I cut it a 1/4\" longer than the width of the front frame rails and welded small caps over the end. The top of the bumper is held on by a bolt that goes through the winch mount, through the bumper, and then through the frame. The bottom bolt goes through the frame and a small piece of 2\"x2\"x3/16\" angle welded to the back of the bumper just like I'd done on the rear bumper. I managed to cut off an additional 2\" from the frame horns to improve the angle of approach. In the middle of the bumper, with just enough clearance for a roller fairlead, is a single shackle bracket.</p> <p>The 25\" cut out of the middle of the frame will not bring the frame specifications for the flat fender, but this is intentional. CJ-2As have a wheel base of about 80\" and this frame will have a wheel base of about 83\". The crossmember/bumper will stick out about 2\" in the rear, but since it is both a crossmember and a bumper, it should look normal. The front axle is moved forward about 1\". This was done to gain room for more rear driveshaft and great stability on the trail. An 83\" wheelbase is about the same as the AMC version of the CJ-5. After the frame was all together and the springs and axles were all bolted on, my buddy Sean came over and helped me test fit the tub, hood, and grill on the frame to see how it laid out. As you can see from the pictures it looks pretty natural.</p> <p>**</p>"},{"location":"projects/pieces/frame2/","title":"Project Pieces and Parts - Frame II","text":"<p>by: Terry L.

The common solution is to weld a fish mouthed gusset over the weld so that the stresses are distributed over a wider area.</p> <p> Inverse fish mouth</p> <p>Near the back, the frame curved up where I was going to be putting this fish mouth, so I decided to try an inverse fish mouth. I cut a piece of 3\"x3/16\" steel so the ends were pointed and ran the piece all the way on the outside of the frame rail from one spring to the other. I stitch welded it every 6\" or so.

Howe</p> <p> A '72 CJ-5 Dana 30 converted to disk brakes</p> <p>I decided right from the start to sell off the Dana 25 and Dana 41 that came with my flat fender and replace them with more modern and stronger units. I had heard stories of breakage with the old axles since they use smaller shafts and low spline counts compared to the stronger axles used in the 70s and 80s.</p> <p>Soon after I purchased the flat fender, I found a '72 CJ-5 in one of those cut and crush junk yards. The good news was the axles where in good shape and had 4.27:1 R&amp;P.; I purchased the front end for $50. I kind of wanted a Dana 44 front end, but the Dana 30 should stand up to the light weight and fairly low horse power of my flat fender. I couldn't beat the price and the '72-'86 CJ Dana 30 is the strongest axle that bolts on to a flat fender without cutting or other major fabrication. The narrow track Dana 30 used from '72-'81 is slightly wider than the Dana 25 and the wide track Dana 30 is wider yet. The width should not be a big issue, the fender will still be over the tires and my turning radius, articulation, and stability should improve.</p> <p>The down side was the Dana 30 had drum brakes up front and my heart was set on disks up front. I happened to have a Dana 30 from an '81 CJ-5 with disks, but 3.54:1 R&amp;P.; To get the disks and low gears, I decided to upgrade the older Dana 30 to disks.</p> <p>The disk conversion for the drum Dana 30 is quite simple, no fabrication is required if you have the right parts. The first step is to strip both axles down to just the housing with the gears in place. To do this you must: - Remove the hub/lockout: On Warn premium hubs you have to remove the cap screws and remove the dial. Remove the snap ring on the end of the axle shaft and remove the 6 bolts holding it to the brake hub. - Remove the brake hub and drum/rotor: First, you have to hammer back the locking washer that holds the spindle nut in place. Remove the outside spindle nut, locking washer, inner spindle nut, and inner washer. A 2 1/16\" spindle nut socket is the best tool for removing the spindle nut. Pull off the brake hub and drum/rotor. - Remove the Spindle: On the drum brake, you must remove all the springs, shoes, and brake hose at this time. Brake tools pay for themselves when assembling and disassembling drum brakes. Six nuts hold the spindle to the knuckle. Remove these nuts with a 9/16\" socket and begin the sometimes ardous task of removing the spindle from the knuckle. On the drum brake version, the backing plate should pull right off this time so you can hammer at the spindle with the backing plate out of the way. Try to get a chisel behind the spindle and/or put an old spindle nut on the end and hit that. You can also strike the spindle on the part in between were the two bearings ride, but if it is stuck firmly, this won't be enough. - Pull the Shaft: Once the spindle has been removed, carefully slide the shaft out. - Remove the knuckle: Remove the cotter pins that lock the ball joint nuts in place and remove the the two nuts. You should be able to pop the knuckle off by hitting it and the ball joint end. An old nut on the end of the ball joint can help protect the end of the ball joints if they are still in good shape.</p> <p>Once everything is apart, you are ready to put things back together. I did some mixing a matching to get the strongest combination possible. For me, the process for reassembly was slightly complicated for various reasons. The steps follow:</p> <p> Dana 30 shaft gets a new u-joint  Dana 30 spindles  Drum brake lugs vs. disk brake lugs  Installing new inner bearing seal</p> <p>**Install Disk Brake Knuckles: ** The first step was to install the knuckles with the caliper bracket. Simply slide the ball joints in place and torque to spec.</p> <p>**Install Shafts: ** Next I needed to install the shafts. Both set of shafts were of the same length, but the '81 CJ-5 Dana 30 uses a shaft that is slightly thicker between the splines and yoke. For this reason, I decided to go with the newer shafts.</p> <p>The only problem was, One of the u-joints was badly frozen and needed to be replaced. Replacing the u-joint can be done with a bench vise, socket set, hammer, and screwdriver. The hammer and screwdriver are handy for removing the old rusty clip that retains the u-joint. After the four clips are removed, I use a 11/16\" socket and 1\" socket to press out the joint one way, remove the cap, and press out the joint the other way to remove the other cap. The little socket goes on the cap to be pressed in and the big socket goes around the cap that is being pressed out. If the joints are stiff, apply pressure and tap the side of the yoke with a hammer to slightly elongate the yoke and the cap will pop.</p> <p>The other u-joint was in good shape, so I left it in place. The shafts are easy to install, you just slide them in and try not to damage the inner seal.</p> <p>**Install Spindles: ** After the shafts are in place, the spindles can be installed. The drum brake Dana 30 uses a slightly different spindle than the disk brake version. The disk brake spindle is fatter on the the inside than the drum brake spindle. Since I loaned one of my drum brake spindles to a friend, I opted to use the disk brake spindles. I applied RTV between the spindle and knuckle so they don't rust together. If I had anti-seize at the time, I would have used that.</p> <p>**Install Brake Hub: ** The '72 CJ-5 used a brake hub for a six bolt lock-out with Warn Premium hubs on it. The '81 CJ-5 used a brake hub for a five bolt lock-out with cheap factory hubs. I wanted to use the old brake hub, this meant I had to swap over the rotor and switch bearings.</p> <p>The first step in removing the rotor is removing the studs. Put an old lug nut on the lugs and hammer on it until the lug pops out. After all the lugs are removed, the rotor should fall free of the brake hub. The disk brake axle uses a slightly different lug with a long shoulder to go through the rotor.</p> <p>The reason I had to switch bearings is because I had installed the spindles from the disk brake Dana 30. The disk brake Dana 30 uses a spindle that is fatter on the inside and the same diameter on the outside. Last Four Digits of Dana 30 Bearings OuterInnerTypeBearingRaceBearingRaceDrum1349131013491310Disk1349131029492910* My bearings were in good shape, so I just removed them from the disk brake hub, repacked them, and installed them in the drum brake hub. The bearings can be driven out and installed with a screw driver and hammer. There is a channel on the side that should be used to do this so you don't damage the bearing or race. Removing the inner bearing seal almost always destroys it, so I installed new inner bearing seals all around.</p> <p> Packing the bearings After the bearings and races were installed, I put the rotor on the older brake hub and set the disk brake lugs in place with a hammer to hold the rotor in place.</p> <p>Once the rotor and bearings are in place, installing the brake hub is a matter of sliding it over the spindle installing the inner washer, inner nut, and torquing to spec. After the inner nut is installed the locking washer and outer nut are installed, torqued, and the washer is bent over with a screw driver or the like.</p> <p>**Install Hub/Lock-out: ** Installing the hub/lock-out is a piece of cake, especially with snap ring pliers. With the Warn Premium hubs, slide the hub body over the shaft and put the snap ring on the end o the shaft. Sometimes, prying the shaft behind the knuckle will help get the shaft in place to get the snap ring on. After the snap ring is seated, bolt on the outer piece of the hub/lock-out. After the hubs/lock-outs are installed, you should be done.</p> <p> Disk brake with new rotor If you are considering a disk brake upgrade for your 70s CJ with drum brake, I've heard from a few people that the stock master cylinder and proportioning valve work with out modification. I've never tried it myself, but a few people have said it works. I'm planning on using a master cylinder and and swing arm pedal from a '77 CJ-7 with disk brakes and a proportioning valve from a '73 Scout II, but that will come later. I've selected these parts only because I happen to have them. I need to repair the tub before I can plumb the brakes up.</p>"},{"location":"projects/pieces/od/","title":"Project Pieces and Parts - Over Drive","text":"<p>The Warn (aka Saturn) Overdrive is a real treat for any flat fender.

Howe</p> <p> The finished product</p> <p>Anyone will tell you that the key to a good paint job is the prep work. Body work on a Jeep is something you need to strike a delicate balance between looking good and not wasting a lot of time. I wasn't building this Jeep to be a show truck and I knew I'd be scratching and denting the body before too long anyway. I probably ended up spending too much time on the prep work. It is hard not to get carried away, but the results were excellent.</p> <p>This Jeep was a real challenge to paint because every piece of metal was bent or rusted through, but it is only a Jeep. Jeeps have relatively little metal body to begin with, there's no roof! Jeeps also have mostly flat panels and simple curves.</p> <p>I'd spent the past four years driving a beater and for the most part it is a lot of fun. I could wheel with reckless abandon, but I was getting tired of having such an ugly Jeep. The plan with this Jeep was to make it good looking, but easy to repair.</p> <p>A solution to the maintainability was to chose a color I could easy get touch up paint for. In the past, I'd picked odd-ball colors that I liked, but I couldn't touch up scratches because I couldn't find any touch up paint that was close. I'd also gone the rattle can path in the past and I wasn't happy with the color selection, price, or the durability of the finish. I decided to chose a color from a new model so I could easily get touch up paint, the color I chose was the new Jeep Chili Pepper Pearl Metalic. I loved the color the first time I saw a TJ painted this color.</p> <p>From past experience, I knew I wasn't the neatest painter in the world. I tend to lay it on too heavy which causes sagging, etc. I enrolled the help of Roger Wild, a friend of mine who has done a lot of painting in the past. Since Roger was going to shoot it, I asked him to choose the type of paint and he chose Dupont Centari. The Dupont Centari is a bit of an old school paint, it is a one step process, not like newer paints where you shoot color and then clear coat. A good paint just the same and not cheap. Since the flat fender had such a small body and I was only planning on shooting the exterior, I only had two quarts mixed up. The paint with a hardener and some reducer ran me over $140. The primer was extra.</p> <p> Roger Wild shooting primer in the garage</p> <p>I wasn't going to shoot the interior since I had already Durabaked the inside and the underside I had already rattle canned black. I rattle canned the underside black to make it more maintainable if I decide to go with a different color in the future.</p> <p>Painting the Jeep was an all weekend project working a lot of hours. I had some last minute Bondoing, sanding, and masking to do before shooting primer. We also had to set up my garage to shoot the primer in the winter time.

Howe</p> <p> '50 CJ-3A Dana 41</p> <p>The Dana 41 axle that came with my CJ-2A was from a '50 CJ-3A. It is a fairly strong axle, but the shaft spline count is low, 10 spline I believe. It also uses a two piece shaft which is weaker than a one piece shaft of the same size. You often hear about 70s and 80s CJs with the AMC 20 \"spinning a hub\". This happens when the outer hub of the shaft spins on the splines. I didn't want this to happen to me.</p> <p> '71 CJ-5 Dana 44</p> <p>The ultimate low buck axle upgrade for the flat fender is the mid 1970 to 1971 CJ-5 Dana 44. Around mid 1970 they started using a Dana 44 with 30 spline, one piece shafts. It is offset for the Dana 18 transfer case rear output and the spring perches bolt right on to any flat fender military or civilian as well as early CJ-5s with the Dana 44 with two piece shafts.</p> <p>I was keeping an eye out for one of these fairly rare Dana 44s and patience paid off.

It had a Dana 44 that would not work in my flat fender, but it had 11\" drum brakes that were in excellent shape and they had a parking brake. Even the springs and shoes were in good shape, so I bolted the Commando backing plates to my CJ-5 Dana 44 and used all the parts to reassemble brakes for it.

The suspension is not radical, but it is practical and should perform well.</p> <p>The first thing I wanted to do was convert from the U shaped shackles used on flat fenders to the more rugged H shaped after market shackles used in late CJs. I happened to have some shackle hangers from my '81 CJ-7. The front was about the right width, but the rear was 1/2\" too wide. I trimmed off a 1/4\" from either side of the rear shackle hanger with a circular saw and a metal cutting blade. I removed the old shackle hangers and drilled holes for the new ones. Soon the shackle hangers were bolted in place.</p> <p>Since the narrowed rear shackle hanger was now the same width as the front, so I ordered two sets of bushings and two sets of heavy duty shackles for the front of an '81 CJ-7. The bushings fit perfectly in the shackle hangers, but they too big in diameter for the springs. Someone on the Jeep Tech list suggested I machine them down a bit with a bench grinder.

A jerky engagement can cause a rollover in the wrong situation and it is easier to maintain control of a vehicle if the driver isn't getting thrown around.</p> <p>**Simple Installation: ** Obviously, an automatic does not need any clutch linkage. The clutch linkage, particularly on older Jeeps, has a tendency to bind up and sometimes not work if the frame gets twisted up. Older Jeeps can be converted to hydraulic clutches, but this adds to the complexity of a transmission swap. Admittedly, cooling is a bit more of an issue.</p> <p>**Two Feet: ** With an automatic, there is no need to slip the clutch while you ride the brake with your toes and hit the throttle with your heel. Brake and gas is all you have to worry about. Since driving an automatic is easier, you'll be able to do harder stuff with less stress.</p> <p>**Effective Crawl Ratio: ** Some argue that automatics are only available with a tall first gears when compared with the heavy duty truck transmissions. This is true, but it does not take into account for the torque converter. The torque converter allows slippage to give an automatic an effectively lower first gear. Clutches tend to be engaged or disengaged.</p> <p>**Engine Selection: ** Most new cars come with automatic transmissions. Some engines, like my Buick 231 V6 are hard to find with a flywheel on them. Technically this engine needs to be rebalanced if a flywheel is put on where a flex plate once lived. Also, late model engines have computer controlled engines and transmissions. With these engines, it is best to keep a matched engine, computer, and transmission to get all the performance benefits.</p> <p>**TH350 vs. TH400: ** Some people will argue that a TH400 is everything a TH350 is, but it is stronger. It is a stronger transmission, but there are a couple important advantages to the TH350. The biggest advantage of the TH350 is that is is 3\" or 4\" shorter than the TH400. It would be very difficult to fit a TH400 in a pre '72 CJ and hard to do for a '72-'83 CJ-5. The couple inches makes a big difference which makes it an excellent choice for a short Jeep. The other advantage is the TH350 is more efficient than the TH400. The Turbo 400 wastes more power than the Turbo 350, so the Turbo 350 will have a snappier feel.</p>"},{"location":"projects/pieces/trans/#the-search","title":"The Search","text":"<p>The first step is finding a good used transmission. My transmission guy recommended that I purchase a good running transmission because the parts that typically need to be replaced in a core will cost a lot more than the cost of a runner. He ended up locating one for me that only cost $100 with no torque converter. I bought a new torque converter for around $55. Not all Turbo 350s are the same, there are several variations and if you are going to spend the money on a transmission, you might as well find the right one.</p> <p>**Lock Up vs. Non-Lock Up: ** Newer TH350s use a lock-up torque converter. The advantage of the lock-up is it is more efficient on the highway. When you are in third gear and the RPMs get to a certain level, the distributor triggers the torque converter. This makes the transmission work at a straight 1:1 with no lost power from torque converter slippage. These transmissions are considered to have 3 1/2 gears because of the lock-up.</p> <p>The down side to the lock-up is the torque converter is not any larger than the non-lock-up version. The clutches take up a lot of space in the converter and so the converter tends to generate more heat. My transmission guy strongly recommended I get a non-lock-up version of the transmission because they last much longer.</p> <p>The lock up version can be easily identified by the plug it has on the drivers side. It is normally a four prong weather pack plugs, not all the wires are used from what I've seen. The version that does not have a lock up torque converter doesn't have any wires to it at all.</p> <p>**V8 vs. V6: ** Another variation on the Turbo 350 is the clutch packs. Turbo 350s used with V8 engines use much larger clutch packs than the versions used with six cylinder engines. Since four wheeling tends to be very hard on transmissions, I made sure I got the V8 version with the big clutch packs.</p> <p> Turbo 350 Chevy tail shaft</p> <p>**Tailshaft: ** There are several variations on tailshafts. There are long and short tail shafts and the Chevy version uses a different opening for the speedometer output. This won't matter for your Jeep though, because the Advanced Adapters kit replaces the tailshaft. The case on the left has a recently replaced Chevy short tail shaft on it.</p> <p>**2WD vs. 4WD: ** It is best to get a 4WD version of the Turbo 350 because it will save you some money on the adapter. If you get the 2WD version you will have to pay a couple extra bucks for the right output shaft. The Turbo 350 was used in some full size Blazers and similar trucks. Sometimes people get dual pattern cases built for these trucks so they can drop in Caddy engines.</p> <p> Turbo 350 dual pattern front</p> <p>**Bolt Pattern: ** The Turbo 350 case commonly comes with three different bolt patterns. Some cases have a Chevy engine bolt pattern, some cases have the Buick, Olds, Pontiac, and Caddy bolt pattern, and some have both. It is well worth getting the dual pattern, or unicase, Turbo 350. If you ever think you might do an engine swap, you won't have to worry about the transmission. It will also help the resale of the transmission because it will work with more engine combinations.</p> <p>The Buick, Olds, Pontiac, and Caddy engine bolt pattern is easily identified by the valley at the top and the Chevy pattern is peaked on the top. The dual pattern transmission in the picture on the right has both patterns. You can see the valley and peak. Each set of bolts around the top is in a pair. The alignment pin and the lower bolt is the same.</p>"},{"location":"projects/pieces/trans/#the-rebuild","title":"The Rebuild","text":"<p>What I ended up buying was a 2WD, V8 version, dual pattern Turbo 350 that did not have a lock-up torque converter. There is no sense in trying to convert a lock-up transmission to a non-locking version or visa-versa because too many parts are different. If you run try to run a lock-up version without hooking up the lock-up, the transmission life will be shortened.</p> <p> Adapter kit</p> <p>Since the transmission had to be torn all apart to install the Spicer 18 adapter from Advanced Adapters, I had Dave, my transmission guy, install new clutches and replace any other parts that were worn. The kit includes a new output shaft, a spud shaft with the 6 spline output for the Spicer 18, some bearings, a rear output bearing retainer, assorted o-rings, snap rings, and seals, and a machined plate to bolt the Spicer 18 to the Turbo 350. I picked up the transmission at Dave's shop and went home to bolt it up. When I tried to bolt on the transfer case, it wouldn't go on because I had a small hole Spicer 18 and the Dave had installed the big hole rear bearing retainer. It turned out the kit from Advanced Adapters only had the big hole bearing retainer in it. I called A/A and they told me I could use the stock bearing retainer for the small hole transfer case. My buddy Tom Hackle gave me the bearing retainer from a shelled out T-90 and I ran back to Dave's shop to get the correct retainer installed. He switched it around in a matter of minutes. The good part about this little mix up is I know have the big hole bearing retainer, so if I end up swapping on a big hole Spicer 18 or a Dana 20, all I have to do is swap the retainer. If you have a stock T-90 that you can take the bearing retainer from, you'd be better of ordering the big hole version of the adapter. This will make you more flexible for future swaps.</p> <p>I had to purchase a new torque converter since the transmission I bought didn't have one. According to my transmission guy, it is important to match the torque converter with the engine. Appartently, there are subtle differences between the Chevy and Buick torque converters.</p>"},{"location":"projects/pieces/trans/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>Installation was a breeze. I just bolted the torque converter in place, slid on the transmission, and bolted it up. **Transmission Mount: ** The kit from Advanced Adapters includes a transmission mount and a little adapter for the transmission mount.

I drilled new holes in the cross member to work with the new engine and transmission combination.</p> <p> Transmission mount  Transmission coolers  Turbo 350 installed</p> <p>The cross member used in the '73 Commando is almost identical to the cross member used in the '50 CJ-3A frame that was originally under my Jeep. The Commando one had some bends in it that gave better clearance for the transfer case, so I decided to use it.</p> <p>The style of cross member used on these older Jeeps is simple and easy to work with, but they hang down a lot lower than necessary. Eventually, I'll fabricate my own cross member and skid plate that will provide better clearance.</p> <p>**Hook Up: ** There are two things that control the transmission, vacuum and the kick down cable. A vacuum line runs from the manifold to the governor on the back of the transmission. There was a small line on my engine that appeared to be used for this purpose, so I hooked up the vacuum to this line. The kick down cable runs to the throttle linkage on the carburetor. Since my engine had an automatic before, it was a simple matter to hook this up.</p> <p>**Cooling: ** Keeping the temperature down for an automatic transmission is crucial to prevent damage. Four wheeling tends to be hard on an automatic transmission as well, so the capacity to keep it cool needs to be greater than it would be on a normal car. Since my radiator did not have a tank, I used two 7.5\"x15.5\"x3/4\" oil coolers mounted in front of the radiator. If these don't provide sufficient cooling, I'll install either a larger cooler yet or go with an external oil cooler that runs off coolant.</p>"},{"location":"projects/pieces/trans/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>I don't have any real shift linkage for the transmission yet, but I was able to shift the transmission through the gears when I fired up the engine.

Sean Lazelle solved this problem by getting a tube front end built for his Bronco by RockWare.</p> <p>The Bronco purist will be offended, but if all you care about is driving over big rocks this is the way to go. The actual approach angle isn't improved all that much by doing this to a Bronco, but effectively, the angle greatly improved.

With no grill, it is easy to get a tire on the rocks before the frame or body hits.</p> <p>When I tubed out the rear of my flat fender, there no change in the real departure angle, but corners that used to rub, just aren't there to get in the way. I also don't get rocks jammed in the fenders wells any more. The corners don't get bent up when I hang up on one.

With the tube front end, there are no more vapor lock problems, even with the temperatures over 100. If you wheel in wet areas, the water and dirt on the engine might cause more problems than it is worth. Another benefit of running open fenders is easy maintenance. All the spark plugs and accessories are easy to get to. If there is a problem, it is easier to spot it.

The tubing can be built stronger than stamped steel and protect the engine and radiator during a roll over. When I tubed out the front of my flat fender, I started with a radiator roll bar, a piece of tube bent specifically to protect the radiator. I braced it to the fire wall with two pieces of 1\" tubing and welded it to the front frame rails. The grill bolts to the radiator roll bar and the roll bar has hood pins on it for the hood. I completely removed the fenders, so I needed the hood pins to hold down the hood.</p> <p>I rolled hard out in Farmington shortly after tubing out the front end and my radiator survived completely. The hood and grill were dented pretty badly in the roll, I think without the roll bar, my radiator would have been forced into the engine fan.</p> <p>There are two schools on radiator roll bars, internal and external. I went with an internal radiator roll bar. The down side to this approach is your grill and hood can be damaged in a roll. The up side is the front end looks cleaner and more stock. I wanted to keep the Jeep looking a bit stock and I didn't want my headlights obstructed by a roll bar. I also think a roll bar that extends above the hood would be distracting and annoying to look at.

The only real disadvantage of going SOA is the possibility of inducing wheel hop, but as I will explain later wheel hop is easily controlled. SOA has been used by many manufactures on both front and rear ends, and these OEM SOA setups prove that it works well.</p> <p>You can get your CJ to ramp 1000+ by using Wrangler YJ springs. YJ springs can often be found for free from a friend who has installed lift springs or purchased cheaply used from a 4wd shop. Wrangler springs work well for CJ spring over axle (SOA) conversions because their length and their arc. The YJ springs are slightly longer than CJ springs and a longer spring has more droop than a shorter spring. The stock YJ springs are almost flat under load which makes them good for a spring over because they do not provide any more lift. A spring over alone normally provides more than sufficient lift. Another advantage of the flat springs is flat springs articulate better than arced springs during compression.</p> <p>With flat arch front springs such as YJ springs an expensive shackle reversal becomes unnecessary and even counter productive. With flat arch front springs that are anchored at the rear the tire will move towards the rear on either compression or extension. The reason is the flat arch places the tire at it's farthest forward point when the suspension is at rest, and when the spring arches either positively or negatively the arch will cause the tire to be moved slightly rearwards.</p> <p>With the flat arch springs on a SOA you can also angle your front shackles further forwards than most people normally would. The reason you can do this is similar to the reason a shackle reversal becomes unnecessary, the shackle end spring eye will move towards the rear on either compression or extension. This has 2 benefits. First it gives the shackles more room to move rearwards and frees up more droop. Secondly having the shackles raked forwards makes it less likely that you will pop one over center to the rear and bend a spring.</p>"},{"location":"suspension/cjsoa/#springs","title":"Springs","text":"<p>The rear springs used in CJs and YJs are the same width, so the rear springs bolt right in.

They need to be moved forward so that the rear hole in the spring hanger goes where the old front hole used to be. There is a rivet in the frame at the location where the new front hole needs to be. The rivet holds the cross member in place. I welded the cross member to the frame, ground the heads off the rivets and punched them out. The bolt holes lined up perfectly. The picture to the left shows where the front spring hanger needs to be modified. The red arrow points to the rivet to be removed and the blue area shows where to weld. Weld before removing the rivet so everything stays in place. The rivet hole will be used for the forward bolt on the spring hanger.</p> <p> Moving the hanger forward leaves a space between the steering box bracket and frame where the back part of the spring hanger used to be. I cut off a piece of the old spring hanger and used it as a shim. The red arrow points to the spacer for the steering box made from the old front spring hanger.</p> <p>The rear hangers do not have an extra hole to clear the rivet that you knocked out, so they are much stronger than the stock front spring hangers.

Another solution is fabricate a bracket to move the drag link over the spring.</p> <p>For my personal project I converted to spring over steering. Because of the serious nature of steering work I'm going to say \"If you have to ask how you shouldn't try to build it yourself.\" Although I designed the arms myself I enlisted the help of a fellow 4 wheeler who is also an expert machinist to do the actual work. Many of the companies that make custom width front ends are selling similar spring over steering kits. The kits consist of steering knuckles from a '74-76 FSJ or Chevy and some custom steering arms that bolt to the flat area on top of the knuckle. These kits put the tie rod about as high as the top of the diff cover, which works out perfectly for SOA with YJ springs.</p> <p>By custom designing my steering arms I was able to retain the use of stock wide track CJ linkages even though my Dana 44 front is 2\" wider than my Dana 30 was.

The problem is accentuated with soft, flat springs that articulate well. You will need some kind of spring wrap control or you will break u-joints, drive shafts, and even yokes. When the spring wrap unloads, it causes wheel hop which can cause a roll in an off-camber situation. Some sort of anti-spring wrap measures must be taken.</p> <p> I used a ladder bar with a shackle and threaded section on the leading side and a fixed mount to the axle tube on the trailing side. It controls axle wrap and wheel hop completely while still allowing full articulation. My ladder bar does this by controlling the pinion angle while still allowing every other type of movement including twisting. If the pinion angle can't change the springs will not wind up and wheel hop is prevented. I bent my ladder bar and broken the axle tube mount by testing on pavement and rocks, but even in this half functional state it still worked fine. I've been driving with this setup for a whole season already and so far I've experienced no wheel hop.</p> <p>I fabricated the axle end mount for the ladder bar to put the bottom bar only an inch or so below the axle tube and the top bar about 8 inches above. The front end of the bar mounts to a frame cross member I built, but many people mount them to their skid plate.

The pros and cons of shackle reversal should be understood before you spend your hard earned money on a kit.</p> <p>Some argue that if shackle reversal was so great, why didn't they make Jeeps with reversed shackles from the factory? Well they did, the military version of the CJ-5, the M38A1 always had the shackle to the rear. The CJ always had the shackle forward there and it is hard to decide whether Jeep engineers were just unwilling to try new things or intentionally built civilian Jeeps shackle forward.</p>"},{"location":"suspension/elkcahs/#handling","title":"Handling","text":"<p>The purpose of a shackle reversal is to allow the tire move backwards easily when it hits a bump to smooth out the ride.

Obviously, springs do not shrink and grow, but the distance between the eyes changes when they flex. Flat springs are at their maximum length at rest and any flex decreases the distance between the eyes.</p> <p> With flat arch springs on a CJ or YJ with the conventional setup the tire already goes backwards as it goes up, in fact it also goes backwards as it goes down. This is because the spring is it's longest when it is flat and curving it either way shortens the spring and draws the tire towards the fixed end. This can be demonstrated on any stock YJ by noting the angle of the shackle relative to the frame when it is sitting on flat ground, and then again when one tire has been run up a ramp. On the ramp the bottom end of both front shackles will be more towards the rear than when on flat ground because one spring will be arched positively and one negatively.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"suspension/elkcahs/#axle-movement-with-arched-springs","title":"Axle Movement With Arched Springs","text":"<p>With heavily arched springs such as used in normal 4\" spring under axle lift kits and the conventional fixed spring hanger at the rear the front tire will come forwards when it rises to go over a bump. This is because the spring is moving towards being flat, rather than away from being flat.</p> <p> As the spring moves towards being flat the arch decreases and the length of the spring increases, pushing the tire slightly forwards.</p> <p> A shackle reversal puts the fixed end of the spring at the front, which makes the tire go rearwards on compression instead of forwards. This is very desirable for handling reasons. This is why shackle reversals are popular with after market lift springs on YJs and CJs.</p>"},{"location":"suspension/elkcahs/#bump-steer","title":"Bump Steer","text":"<p>Besides allowing for smoother motion over bumps, a shackle reversal reduces bump steer.

The reason is similar to the reason for the improved highway ride. When the brakes are applied the tire is effectively pulled hard to the rear of the Jeep by the braking force. On a Jeep with arched springs and a shackle reversal the rearward pull will cause the springs to flatten out or compress. The compression from the tire pulling back combined with the forwards weight transfer that normally happens during braking cause the nose of the Jeep to drop more than a non shackle reversed jeep.</p> <p>With arched springs and no shackle reversal the force of the tire being pulled towards the rear of the Jeep causes the spring to arch more. The spring arching and the natural forwards weight transfer somewhat cancel each other out and front end dive is limited.</p>"},{"location":"suspension/elkcahs/#the-driveshaft-problem","title":"The Driveshaft Problem","text":"<p>Another disadvantage of shackle reversal is the need for a drive shaft with more travel.

A drive shaft that is too short will fall apart when droop is maximized. A drive shaft that is too long can be punched through a transfer case. Long travel drive shafts can be expensive and long travel drive shafts wear quicker than short travel drive shafts.</p> <p>With no shackle reversal and arched springs the tire goes forwards as it goes up and rearwards as it goes down. The forwards and upward motions partially cancel each other resulting in less of a length change on the driveshaft. The same cancellation effect happens as the tire goes rearwards and down.

The tools to build it can be found in most garages and the parts won't cost an arm and a leg. The following parts are necessary for the project:</p> <ul> <li>2 - Stock Rear CJ Spring Packs (post-'76) or stock YJ Spring Packs (front or rear)</li> <li>2 - Stock Rear CJ or YJ U-bolt plates</li> <li>4 - Custom bent U-bolts with washers and nuts</li> </ul> <p> The first thing to do to make your 3/4 elliptical spring pack is to remove centering pin from CJ spring packs. Next, remove spring clamps that hold the pack together. They may pop apart when the clamps are released. Pull out the main leaves and cut them 5-1/2\" from the centering pin towards the small bushing. A hand grinder, or circular saw with metal cutting blade, will make this cut.</p> <p> After the main leaf is cut to length, drill a new 3/8\" hole 3\" in from the cut end. Re-install the centering pin in new hole. After a quick coat of paint, the quarter leaves should be ready for installation.</p> <p> Raise the rear of the vehicle so the rear tires are just touching the ground and support with jack stands. Working one side at a time, remove the rear shackle from the frame and spring. Place the quarter leaf spring under frame so bushing and original shackle mount are lined up front to rear. Mark the location of the centering pin on frame and set the quarter leaf aside. Drill a 1/2\" hole on bottom of frame for the centering pin. Use a spare 1/2\" bolt to line up the U-bolt plate and use the U-bolts to mark the location for holes through the cross member welded inside the frame rail. Drill two 9/16\" holes per side in the cross member for u-bolts. Craig had to remove the exhaust to drill the holes through the cross member on the passenger side. Install the U-bolts over frame and through the 9/16\" holes.</p> <p> Place the quarter leaf spring onto the bottom of the frame and put the centering pin into 1/2\" hole. Secure the quarter leaf spring with the U-bolt plates and tighten the U-bolts to 90 ft/lbs. Re-install the shackles to the quarter leaf spring bushing and the original spring bushing.</p> <p>Craig reports that it took him about 3 hours to do the 3/4 elliptical conversion. On his YJ, he got about 1-1/4\" of lift from the conversion, similar to the amount of lift you would get from a shackle lift. Since this lift will turn the pinion upwards, you may be able to remove any shims that were installed for a lift kit. On a CJ, the lift would be next to nothing since the top of the shackle on a CJ mounts on the bottom of the frame.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"suspension/ubolt/","title":"Flip Your U-Bolts","text":"<p>Are you tired yet of dragging, bending, and breaking your axle u-bolts on rocks? Well flip your u-bolts to gain ground clearance and protect them from damage. I was able to do the u-bolt inversion for around $50 and it only took me a couple of hours.</p> <p> The first thing that is needed to perform a u-bolt inversion are u-bolt plates from an 80s 1/2 ton Dodge pickup or Dodge Ramcharger. There are probably other sources for plates like these, but these plates are pretty easy to find. I purchased some u-bolt plates from an auto recycler for less than $20. You should be able to pick them up for next to nothing since they are not exactly an item that normally generates any revenue for an auto recycler.</p> <p>The 80s Dodge Ramcharger and 1/2 ton pickup use a Dana 44 rear end, so the plates will work for for any Jeep with a Dana 44 or AMC 20 rear end. The CJ AMC 20 uses a slightly smaller tube, so you might want to grind the plates a bit to get a better fit. The Dodge trucks are spring over in the rear and the plates are curved to fit a Dana 44 with square u-bolts attaching the axle to the spring.</p> <p>The Dodge plates have a shock mounted integrated into the plate. Since the plates are run upsidedown from the way they are run on the Dodge, the shock mount is really to high to be useful. I cut them off with a circular hand saw with a metal cutting blade.</p> <p> After you have aquired some u-bolt plates, you need to get some u-bolts. I went to my local spring shop (Rocky Mountain Spring in the Springs) and had custom square u-bolts made 4\" long and 2.5\" wide. The cost was only $26 for these u-bolts.</p> <p> The last item needed is some way to attach the shock to the axle. On CJs, the shock bolts to the u-bolt plate. What I did to resolve this problem was purchase some Con-Fer shock mounts for $5 and weld them to the axle tube. You could fabricate your own shock mounts and weld them on, but for the the price, it wasn't worth it to me. If you don't have access to a welder, it would probably only take a professional welder a few minutes to attach the shock mounts for you.</p> <p>If the idea of welding shock mounts does not appeal to you, there is one other option that Chris Kutish came up with. Chris took a small piece of 3/4\" steel and machined out grooves in it for the square u-bolts. Then he drilled it and tapped it for a replaceable shock mount stud. He also machined down the leading and trailing edges so it would slide over rocks easier. One advantage of this approach is the force of the u-bolts is spread out over the springs. This approach also keeps the shock a bit lower than the weld on brackets which may provide more articulation. A disadvantage of this approach is you lose about a quarter inch of ground clearance and it is much more time consuming to fabricate the plates than weld on the mount.</p> <p>After the shock mount was welded on and painted, I put the Jeep on jack stands, removed the old u-bolts, put the plate on top of the axle tube, and bolted on the square u-bolts with the nuts on the top.</p> <p>I first saw this u-bolt inversion done on a CJ-7 owned by Rick Borios.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"suspension/yjsh/","title":"Wrangler YJ Travel Trick","text":"<p>Before After</p> <p>I was helping Eric Resko install a Dana 44 rear end in his '87 Wrangler when he showed me a neat trick to increase travel of the rear axle.

For significantly larger tires it is usually necessary to upgrade these components, especially where traction aiding devices such as lockers or limited slip is used, or you may risk breaking one of these components on the trail.</p> <p>Bigger tires are heavier tires. This increased rotating mass and the increased leverage provided by the larger tire often call for increases in braking power: changing brake pad materials, rear disc brake conversions, beefing up the master cylinder or even switching to larger disk and calipers are all options. Driving a tall, heavy, modified short wheelbase Jeep with 35\" tires and stock brakes in poor condition at highway speeds can be a recipe for disaster!</p> <p>Increases weight caused by the larger tire and any axle or brake upgrades also increases unsprung weight. This does not matter much on the trail, but can make the ride a higher speeds much more harsh. When mounting the tire you will find that it is often much more difficult to balance the tire correctly. This is due to the extra weight of the tire, the increased rotating inertia of the tire and manufacturers tolerances on larger tires. It can take quite a bit of weight to balance a large tire and many shops that do not routinely handle tires of this size may not do a good job.</p> <p>So - bigger tires have a price, the bigger the size change the more modifications are needed to properly set up your Jeep; still, on the trail, there are times when putting more rubber on the ground, or more space between the vehicle and the ground, is exactly what you need.</p> <p>On my 1990 Jeep YJ I decided to switch from 31\" tires to 35\" tires while not wanting to risk breakage on the trial. The total price of those 4 35\" tires was probably close to $7,000 dollars!. This included a 4\" suspension lift, a 2\" body lift, fender trimming, changing to heavy duty, custom modified, 1 ton truck axles, changing to 4.10 gears in both differentials (+ lockers and carrier changes), and adding rear disk brakes. In addition the lift and axles necessitated transfer case modifications and custom drive shafts in both ends. It was not a simple, cheap or fast project - but on the trail it sure is sweet!</p>"},{"location":"tire/#trade-offs-tire-size-width","title":"Trade-Offs Tire Size (width)","text":"<p>Tire diameter is not the only issue - tire width is important to. Wider tires increase footprint which can be important for traction or increased flotation. The tradeoff include that wider tires can also require extended fender coverage in many states and may require changes in wheel width &amp; offset to work properly. On stock offset wheels the tires may be mostly covered by the stock fender flares but rub on suspension components when turning thus reducing effective turning radius. The incredibly tight turning radius of a jeep is one of it's important advantages on the trail. Wider wheels or wheels with increased offset move the tires outboard and can greatly reduce the rubbing when turning but make the vehicle wider. This increased width may be an advantage for stability if you drive a lifted vehicle or a disadvantage of you are squeezing down a trail better suited for a Samurai or a quad. Lastly narrower tires can sometimes be an advantage where the best traction is located just a few inches below the surface (such a shallow snow or mud) and the decreased footprint and increased pressure aids the tires in getting down to where it can get a bite.</p>"},{"location":"tire/#tread-patterns","title":"Tread Patterns","text":"<p>The choice of tread pattern is important in your new tire decision making process. Tread pattern should be chosen based on the intended use of the Jeep. The most popular tread pattern for all around off-road use is a mud terrain pattern.</p> <p>The mud terrain or mud tire pattern is characterized by large lugs on the tire with large voids between these lugs. The large lugs provide plenty of bite in low traction conditions while the large voids allow the tire to clean itself by throwing off mud or other material when spinning thus providing a good bite on every rotation of the tire. These tires are also very popular for rock crawling as the large lugs can provide a way of gripping and pulling the tires up and over irregular rocky edges where a smoother pattern would just spin. The biggest disadvantage of these patterns is that they run rough and loud on the highway. To reduce this problem choose a tire with irregular or asymmetric spacing of the lugs and voids to reduce harmonic vibration at highway speeds. There are also situations such cold powder snow or sand where an all-terrain pattern would be better.</p> <p>The general purpose all terrain tire generally has an interlocked tread pattern with siping (small cuts) on the tread blocks. The voids in these tires are also generally much smaller than those on tires designed for use in the mud. The denser pattern of blocks and smaller voids make these tires quieter on the street. It also increases the surface area of the tread which gives the tire improved flotation on surfaces such as light powdery snow or sand. The increased siping can be important in snow were it is the number of edges, even quite small edges, biting into the snow that provides the \"bite\". The downside is that the smaller voids cannot clean themselves as easily of packed mud or slush as the larger voids on mud tires do. If these voids fill up with mud the tire loses much of it's \"bite\" and traction is lost.</p> <p>While the all terrain pattern's improved flotation and additional siping may be an advantage in absolutely dry powder or packed snow, the mud terrain may be the wiser choice if the snow or underlying terrain is, or can turn, slushy or muddy. In these cases the all terrain pattern can become packed with mud and stuck where a mud terrain pattern would self clean and plow on through.</p> <p>In sand the improved flotation provided by the dense tread pattern of the all-terrain tires can be a distinct advantage.</p> <p>A variety of manufacturers also offer a family of tires sometimes called trail tires or something near that. These are most often tires designed for use on light trucks or sport utility vehicles which see most of their use on the street. They will generally be quieter, get better gas mileage and last longer than either of the other off-road patterns. The tread patterns are designed to provide significantly improved comfort or performance on the street which can sometimes compromise serious off-road capability. I personally would not recommend them for anything other than light off-road use in dirt, on unpaved roads or trails where you are unlikely to encounter mud, significant rocks or other unpleasant conditions. Fortunately this is the limit to which most of their intended market are likely to take them.</p>"},{"location":"tire/fit33/","title":"Big Tire, Little Lift","text":"<p>The best set up for your Jeep is to use the least amount of lift possible to fit your target tire size.

Spring lifts also increase your center of gravity since they raise the height of the entire vehicle.</p> <p>Another disadvantage of tall springs is steep drive shaft angles. Steeper drive shaft angles can cause vibration problems and decrease u-joint life. Often, shims are used under the spring perches and transfer case lowering kits are added to resolve drive line vibration problems. The shims have a tendency to break and fall out. Large shims will starve the pinion bearing of gear lube and decrease its life. Sometimes the spring king pin will have to be replaced with a longer one when large shims are used. If the large king pin is not used, the axle housing may shift if the king pin does not have a firm hold in the spring perch.

I used a circular saw with a metal cutting blade to make the cut and touched it up with some paint.</p> <p>Jeep CJs and Wrangler YJ tubs will need this piece removed to fit 33s, or a 4\" suspension lift.

My front end is a Scout Dana 44 cut to CJ wide track specifications. My narrow track Dana 30 would allow the front tires to tuck right in, but the wider axle causes the front tires to rub the outside edge of the front fender. I just bent the fender out a bit to stop the rubbing. If you look closely at the picture to the right, you can see where I bent the fender out by hand, just behind the marker light.

Howe - 1/2002</p> <p> The Art Carr shifter installed with all the gates intact.  The shift linkage on the Art Carr shifter. This cable operated shifter hangs down by the transmission pan.  The shifter with one gate cut out.</p> <p>If you've seen the latest Big Rock video from the ARCA finals in Farmington New Mexico, you've seen a lot of roll overs. There are also some amazing saves in there. In several of the roll overs, the drivers attempt to shift into reverse when the front tires come off the ground, but they miss shift or shift too late. Some of the rolls probably could not have been saved, but some could of been saved if the driver was able to shift correctly and shift quicker.</p> <p>This ability to shift quickly has interested me since I rolled on \"Black Widow\" out in the Rock Garden of Farmington, New Mexico. I'm not sure if I would of saved the roll, but I hit park instead of reverse and blipped the throttle. That didn't help.</p> <p>I was using a Daytona cheap-o-shifter that ran me about $45. It is completely ungated except it locks in park. Well, it used to lock in park, but the pin sheared and it didn't even do that anymore. Anyway, when trying to shift quickly with this shifter, you always have to count the clicks you feel from the transmission to guess which gear you are in. It isn't easy to do if you are in a hurry.</p> <p>To solve the problem, I purchased a cable operated shifter from Art Carr Performance Products. This shifter is very durable and all the gates in it are created by the shifter cover. I installed the shifter and used a cut off wheel to remove the gates that I didn't want. The first time around, I only removed the gate between neutral and third. This was pretty good, and you can see the picture of the shifter with the gate removed on the lower right, but a month after that, I also cut the gate out between second and third. With these two gates removed, I can shift very quickly between first and reverse. I have not needed to test it to see if it really works, but I really like the way it shifts between first and reverse. When you are four wheeling, this always seems to be the shift you are making and I can really slam gears with no missed shifts. The only thing I didn't like about the Art Carr shifter over the Daytona shifter is the way the linkage ties in. The cable is nice and beefy, but the cable comes in from the bottom where as the Daytona shifter had a rod that come in from the top. You don't have to worry about hitting the rod at all, but the cable bracket and shifter hanging down which is not as nice. Fortunately, in first gear, the arm on the shifter is all the way back, so for normal four wheeling, it is not likely I will hit the arm. This set up would work a bit better for a Jeep with a drivers drop transfer case, but I have a passenger drop transfer case. The front drive shaft and transfer case would help protect the shift linkage if I had a drivers drop transfer case, so it would be less of an issue. Either way, I have not hit the linkage yet.</p> <p>On the right is a picture of the linkage. It doesn't hang down lower than the pan on my TH350, but it is slightly exposed. I don't have a skid plate under my transmission, just a piece of 3/16\" steel welded to the transmission pan.</p> <p>Installing the shifter body was super easy. Since it is a cable operated shifter, you can put it where ever you want. I just screwed the shifter body down on my tunnel cover. The shifter body covered up the hole I had for my old Daytona shifter.</p> <p>So, if you get a chance to watch the Big Rock video from Farmington, keep quick shifts in mind. Watch Matt Peterson in his yellow CJ-7 go over backwards, he hits neutral and revs the engine. Matt has a column shifter. Watch Shannon Campbell on the same obstacle do a wheel stand and jam it in reverse, he saves it. I'm pretty sure, but not positive, that Shannon has an Art Carr shifter. To be fair to Matt, I don't think he would of saved it anyway, but at least he would of hit reverse when he tried. With the Art Carr shifter, I know I'll get the right gear and I'll get it as quick as I can shift it.</p>"},{"location":"transmission/upgrades/ax15swap/","title":"Swapping in AX-15 for a Peugeot BA 10/5","text":"<p>by Mike Moran</p> <p></p> <p>I have been driving my 1987 Cherokee since October 1991.

I negotiated a rather hefty price ($1200) for the trans but it would come with everything for the swap except the transfer case.

I slid on 2 precut long screws (ex-bolts with heads cut off and a slice in it for the screwdriver) in place of the 2 side bolts. This helps support the trans upon removal and reinstallation.

I could fit the 96 application in the outer level, but both trannys had the same measured shaft length beyond the bell housing face.

I went out and purchased a new one for that application. It was a little longer in depth to the 87 but it fit the input shaft of the trans and was real close to the outside diameter of the 87 pilot bearing.

The TF 727 was used in full size Jeeps (SJs and J series pickups) in the 80s and early 90s. It has the standard AMC bolt pattern on the engine side and it has the circular bolt pattern and 23 spline output on the transfer case side. The transfer case bolt pattern for the 727 is the same as Dana 300, and most of the New Process transfer cases used in 1980+ Jeeps.</p> <p> Rick Boiros was kind enough to see how a Dana 300 and TF 727 fit together on his garage floor and take some pictures. The tricky part of this combination is the 727 comes from the factory with a New Process transfer cases which are drivers drop and the Dana 300 is passenger drop. The bolt pattern is the same, but the clocking of the transfer case is different. According to Rick the clocking of the Dana 300 on the 727 is pretty much set since there isn't enough material on the adapter to drill it for an alternate clocking.</p> <p> On a CJ, there is not sufficient clearance for the drive shaft with a stock suspension, but with a three to four inch lift and a dropped bump stop, the drive shaft will not hit the pan. The picture to the right shows the Dana 300 and 727 combination with a 6-8 degree angle on the drive shaft. This angle on the drive shaft gives keeps it clear of the pan.</p> <p>Some people have reported using stock drive shafts with the TF727 swap. Mark Timon says with his 360 and TF727 swap, his rear drive shaft is 20.75\" and his front drive shaft is 32.75\". These are respectable lengths for a CJ-7 with an automatic.</p> <p>A TF727 swap with a New Process transfer case is less of an issue since all New Process transfer cases used in Jeeps are drivers drop, so the clocking would be the same. Some TF727s are used with the NP208 which is a heavy duty transfer case that has a regular yoke output. If the 727 was going to be swapped into a YJ, it might be worth using the NP208 from the donor, since it does not have the slip yoke.</p> <p>Probably the hardest part of doing a TF727 swap is getting the correct kick down linkage. Most full size Jeeps used the AMC 360 during the 80s and early 90s and most CJs and YJs used the AMC 258. The linkage is different and the proper linkage and proper adjustment of the linkage is essential to transmission life. If an engine swap is also planned to a 360 or 401, this will not be an issue.</p> <p>A solution to the kickdown problem is swap in a kickdown cable for the TF727 which is available from Lokar Performance. Racing and hot rod suppliers list this cable in their catalogs. Tom Anhalt reports using it successfully in his '81 full size Cherokee with 258/TF727/NP208 combination.

This results in a small amount of oil leaking out and while usually not causing any problem, it smells, and could find it's way onto the clutch, causing slipping problems.</p> <p>Some SM420's have a tubular shifter and some have a forged shifter, the forged shifter is easier to bend, it can be heated with a torch and pulled into the position you want, whereas the tubular lever tends to collapse when bending. The shifter will have to be bent to give your hand clearance at the dash when shifting to first and third.</p> <p>Very late SM420s have a reverse light switch.</p>"},{"location":"transmission/upgrades/sm420yj/#bell-housing-and-clutch","title":"Bell Housing and Clutch","text":"<p>The bell housing used for this swap is the bell housing from an 1986 Chevy S-10 with a 2.8 V6 and a five speed.

In some cases a different transmission can be the best upgrade to your Jeep as far as performance and reliability. What transmission you select to put in your Jeep depends on what you find and what you have. We'll assume you are keeping your engine and transfer case and that you already have a manual transmission. Also, keep in mind these are my opinions of what will be the cheapest and easiest swap for most people. I haven't done most of these swaps either, a lot of my information came from people on-line and from books (YMMV).</p> <p>Generally, when swapping transmissions, it is best to match the engine with the transmission. The reason being, input shaft alignment with the clutch is crucial for clutch life and performance. Alignment can best be maintained with a OEM bell housing that has the proper input bearing retainer size and input shaft length. In other words, use a GM transmission with a GM engine and Ford transmission with a Ford engine. Since many Jeeps use the same Borg-Warner transmissions used in Ford vehicles, Ford transmissions generally work better with Jeeps. Quality after market bell housings exist to mate different engines with different transmissions, but they add to the cost and complexity of the conversion.

When replacing tires you of course must know the wheel diameter, but this will be stamped on the old tires. If you are browsing through a stack of wheels that are not stamped an easy way to determine the diameter is to measure the maximum diameter from rim to rim and then with a ruler measure the distance from the rim down to the bead seat. Subtract twice the distance which you measured down to the bead seat from the rim to rim diameter and you will have the correct wheel diameter. Wheel diameter is a critical consideration when changing or altering brake components. It is also believed by many that 15\" wheels have a superior bead design and better bead retention than 16\", 16.5\" or 17\" wheels.</p>"},{"location":"wheel/#wheel-width","title":"Wheel Width","text":"<p>The wheel width or rim width is the distance between the outside edges of the bead seat. Most popular rim width for 4x4s would be 6\", 7\", 7.5\", 8\" and 10\". Rims wider than this are usually only used on trucks with extreme overwidth tires. The tire manufacturer will publish guidelines for what rim width should be used with which tire. In general 7\" rims will comfortably work with tires up to 10.5\" wide, 8\" wide rims work for 9.5\" up to 12.5\" wide tires and 10\" wide rims are used for 12.5\" and wider. Many rims will not be available in width wider than 8\" and rims wider than 10\" are much more difficult to find.</p> <p>Rim width relative to tread width has an effect on bead retention when aired down and on the overall tire profile. In general a narrower wheel (from within the manufacturers guidelines) will result in a more rounded profile with a slightly smaller footprint but with slightly greater protection of the wheel. Narrower wheels also may retain the bead marginally better when aired down than will the wider wheels. Wider wheel provide a flatter tire profile and greater footprint. Since the rim is wider it will not be as protected from the rocks as would a narrower wheel with the same tire. The tire carcass will exert less pressure on the wider width bead when aired down and a wider wheel may thus be marginally more likely to lose a bead when pressures are low. Wider wheels, with less sidewall bulge, may reduce the rubbing of large tires on the springs at full turn.</p>"},{"location":"wheel/#backspacing","title":"Backspacing","text":"<p>Backspacing is the distance from the inside rim surface to the backside of the wheel mounting surface.

Winches must be very STRONG. Too little weight means too little metal used in the construction. Too much weight could mean that your front end will sag. A benefit of the Hydraulic winch is that it does weigh less.  Q. How do I select a winch for my truck?","text":"<p>A. The most important thing to consider when selecting a winch is whether it is capable of pulling 1.5 times the gross vehicle weight (GVW) of your vehicle (don't forget to take into account that 12% drop in pulling power for every extra wrap of cable on the drum - a 9000lb winch has a line pull of approx. 7000lbs on the third wrap). GVW is the real world weight of your vehicle, i.e. fully loaded. So fill up your gas tank, load up all those off-road goodies, tools, hi-lift jacks, people and go get your vehicle weighed. Q. What do the different winch gear systems mean and what difference will they make when I'm operating them? A. There are three common gearing systems, worm gear, spur gear and planetary gear. They all do the same job, gear down the high speed motor to a low speed high torque winch drum. The gear reduction ratio is by how much the motor's output revolutions are reduced for the spindle. The greater the reduction, the more revolutions the motor has to turn for one spindle revolution and the less the motor has to work for that revolution. The difference in the gearing systems is mainly in their transfer efficiency.</p> <p>The worm gear has a transfer efficiency of 35-40%. This causes the winch to be self-braking even under heavy loads, but this means the unit will need a clutch mechanism for free spooling. Worm gears offer the most reduction, very high reliability, built-in braking mechanism, and generally a slower winching speed.</p> <p>The spur and planetary gear systems have efficiencies of 75% and 65% respectively. This means they have a tendency to free spool when loaded, therefore, a braking mechanism is needed. Planetary gears are the most common and provide both strength and smooth operation with good resistance to torque loads.  Q. I've noticed while looking through the manufacturer's catalogs that there are different types of electric motors. What is the difference between series wound motors and permanent magnet motors? Is one better than the other? A. An electric motor basically has two major parts, the stator and the rotor (or armature). It is the job of the stator to produce a magnetic field which will cause the rotor to rotate when an electric current flows through it.</p> <p>In a permanent magnet motor, the stator uses permanent magnets. This means the current drain on the battery is lower than series wound motors (which uses field coils in the stator). Permanent magnet motors are good for light and medium duty winches, but winching time and load has to be carefully monitored as they tend to overheat. Series wound motors are used in heavier duty winches, but tend to cost more.  Q. Will my electrical system cope with the extra load of an electrical winch? A. For most pulls, yes. There a lot of people out there with one battery, stock alternator, and a winch. Keep in mind though that running a winch is the equivalent to moving your truck on the starter motor, there is a tremendous draw. Most electric winches draw around 400 amps at full load which is far more than even a high output alternator will produce. Stock alternators typically produce 40-90 amps at peak output and the battery will keep up for only so long. Because of this, many people install high output alternators and dual battery systems to support an electric winch.</p> <p>When shopping for a high output alternators, remember to consider alternator output at idle, these figures can differ wildly, especially on older models. Regardless of what alternator you have, it is a good idea to keep up the RPMs while you are winching if possible. Most alternators have peak outputs near cruising RPMS. Also, keep you truck running after winching to give your battery time to recover.</p> <p>Upgrading the battery or going to a dual battery system is also a good idea. The more cold cranking amps your battery (or batteries) produces, the longer you can pull without your engine running. An electronic battery management system is also a good idea to isolate the batteries.</p> <p>After you have got power to the winch you will need to get it back to the battery. Ensure your grounding system is capable and all connections are clean, this is where most systems waste power. The best grounding systems will use large diameter cables (such as welding cables), the battery negative post connects to the engine block, the alternator ground connects to the engine (usually through its case) and then the frame is connected to the engine using a grounding strap. The best bet is to connect the a ground directly from the winch to the battery.  Q. I want to be able to winch from either the front or the back of my truck, are the receiver mounted winches any good? A. Receiver mounted winches are very useful, but remember their static pull load is limited by the receiver they fit into. For a class III hitch that is 5000lbs. Because of this, receiver mounted winches are not really suitable for full sized trucks. Q. When I buy my winch, what comes with it, and what else do I need to start using it? A. Most winches come with nothing, but some places do a deal which includes the remote cable control and fairlead hawser. You will also need the mounting kit for your vehicle. I strongly recommend you buy the winch manufacturers kit. It has been designed for that winch and vehicle with all safety aspects considered. Home made winch mounts are disasters looking for a place to happen.</p> <p>Your winch will now work, but it is limited to straight line pulls between two vehicles. The addition of the following items will greatly increase your winch's usefulness - Tree saver straps (never wrap a cable directly round a tree, you will kill the tree and kink your cable), a couple of clevis pins, snatch blocks, a choke chain and of course thick leather gloves.</p> <p>Attach tow hooks to the frame on all four corners of your vehicle.  Q. What safety equipment will I need? A. You just need your leather gloves and common sense. Never handle the cable with bare hands, a frayed cable can cut skin to the bone. The most common winch accident is getting your fingers caught in the cable as the last of it winds onto the drum. Always use the remote control cable when winching, and keep every one out of range of the cable . Q. What other safety considerations are there? A. Be aware that a broken winch cable can have enough force in its whiplash to cut through a truck's roof and windshield. Imagine what would happen if the cable met a person. A cable that hits a small tree will tear the tree down. A cable that hits a large tree can wrap tightly around a tree so a person behind the tree is not necessarily safe. Solid objects such as hooks and snatch blocks will fly through anything, including a truck's hood, if a cable breaks. People should stand well out of range of the cable and never in line with the cable. Furthermore, if a cable breaks, the truck being winched may roll downhill, so never stand downhill of any vehicle being winched. Q. Is it common to break a winch cable? Should I carry a spare? A. No to both questions. A properly maintained cable is very reliable (see question about maintenance) and carrying a spare will only increase the risk of damaging it. Winch cable is aircraft grade cable and has a breaking strain of 32,000lbs - much higher than the capacity of the winch.</p> <p>It is much more common for for snatch blocks and anchor points to break because they were poorly rigged up. It is a good idea to drape a heavy cloth jacket over the cable to limit the whiplash if something snaps. If someone has to steer the vehicle being winched, then raise the hood for extra protection. Ensure all anchor points are firm.  Q. Is my winch maintenance free? A. Although many people seem to think the answer to this one is yes, the answer is really no! I have met a number of people in the mountains stuck, with a winch that won't work. A little care and preventative maintenance would have ensured its reliability.</p> <p>Your winch should be maintained on a regular basis. Lubricate all required points, inspect all mounts, pulleys, straps and clevis pins, check they are not damaged, or showing signs of fatigue, and are free of moisture. Inspect your remote control lead and electrical system for damage and chaffed insulation. Make sure all terminals are corrosion free and tight. After each trip unspool the cable. Check for kinks and frayed strands (damaged cables should be replaced). Lubricate cable with a chain and cable lubricant (normal grease will collect dirt) and wind back onto drum.  Q. What does using a snatch block achieve? A. Basically it doubles your available pulling power (in fact it's an increase of 85% after safety considerations). It will also allow you to perform pulls at an angle to your truck. People are rarely considerate enough to get stuck straight in front of you. Q. When I double up the winch line using the snatch block, where should I attach the return line. A. If the snatch block is attached to another vehicle, which you are trying to free, then the return line should be connected to a third vehicle or tree, to spread the load.</p> <p>If the snatch block is anchored to a tree and you are trying to free yourself, then the return line should be hooked onto your vehicle's frame. DO NOT hook it back on to the winch mount as this will effectively double the load on the mounting plate.  Q. What is the best way of anchoring my vehicle when I'm trying to winch another vehicle out of trouble? A. Anchor your vehicle to another vehicle or any other fixed object using your tow strap, tree saver, choker chain etc. The one thing to remember is attach the anchor strap to your vehicle at the same end as your winch, otherwise you may stretch your vehicle's frame. Often, simply hitting the brakes will be sufficient to hold your vehicle in place.</p>"},{"location":"winch/#electric-vs-hydraulic-vs-pto","title":"Electric vs. Hydraulic vs. PTO","text":"<p>Just when everyone thought the electric vs. PTO winch war was over, along comes the hydraulic winch. There are still pockets of resistance, but generally, electric winches have won out over the PTO winch. Enter the hydraulic winches and another set of advantages and disadvantages.</p> <p>The PTO (Power Take Off) winch is driven by a small drive shaft that is driven by a PTO adapter that bolts to the transmission or transfer case. Only certain transmissions and transfer cases have PTO ports (e.g. T-18, SM-465, Dana 18, ...). Most electric and hydraulic winches have only one speed, but with a transfer case PTO port, shifting gears can be used to change line speed, torque, and direction. Transmission PTO ports drive off the counter shaft, so they work in one direction and have one speed that can be varied by engine RPM. Since engine power drives the PTO winch, your engine must be working to operate a PTO winch. This is probably the biggest disadvantage of the PTO winch since your engine isn't likely to be running for long when your truck is upside down or under water in a raging river. Not long enough to run out the cable anyway.</p> <p>The electric winch does not require the engine to be running to work, which is it's biggest advantage. The big argument against the electric winch in the past was it would drain you battery and there was no way your alternator could provide sufficient power for a long pull. The automotive industry has made great improvements in alternator and battery technology over the past years which has given the advantage to the electric winch. Batteries have more power and alternators have higher outputs. An electric winch might even work if your truck is upside-down or under water.</p> <p>Some of the advantages of the hydraulic winch are pulling power, pull duration, and weight. The hydraulic winch runs off your existing power steering pump. There is no need to upgrade alternator of battery for the winch, but you may consider upgrading your power steering pump. If you don't have power steering, convert now, regardless of what winch you get. A hydraulic winch should be able to pull harder and longer than a electric winch with out over heating. Hydraulic winches are also much lighter than electric winches, putting less strain on your front axle and front springs.</p> <p>Hydraulic winches suffer from the same disadvantage as the PTO winch, neither works when the engine isn't running. The hydraulic winches I've seen have a real slow line speed, this could an advantage under some circumstances, but generally this is a disadvantage. There is a two speed model, but the high speed is not for use under load. Another disadvantage I've heard from people with hydraulic winches is the reduced ability to steer and winch at the same time.</p>"},{"location":"winch/d18pto/","title":"Jeep Winches: Koenig Dana 18 PTO Adapter","text":"<p> This is how the Koenig Dana 18 PTO adapter looks from behind.

Winch, roller fairlead, bolts, and winch controller.  The winch installed on the bumper and wired up. You can be sure that cable will never be that neat ever again.</p> <p>I heard through a fellow Internet Jeeper that Predator Four Wheel Drive in Colorado Springs was running a special on some brand new Warn 8274 winches. The winches were the old style with the old motor and old solenoid pack, but they were only $699. I had the same winch on my flat fender and CJ-7 for years and I loved it. I couldn't pass up the the opportunity to put one on my CJ-6.</p> <p>A lot of people will ask me if they have any more of these winches. I'm sorry to say, the answer is no. There were only a limited number and they sold pretty fast. When these deals come around, it is well worth jumping on them.</p> <p>My CJ-6, also known as Deep Six, is mostly stock with a single battery and the 258 has the stock alternator. The alternator is the \"heavy duty\" version producing 60 or so amps. The alternator seams to do pretty well with this winch, I didn't see a reason to do an upgrade it. It would be nice to have a dual battery, but I knew my single Interstate battery would do the job in most situations.</p> <p>I happened to have my RockWare Bumperfrom my '81 CJ-7 sitting around and this was the perfect opportunity to put it back in action. I did have to slightly modify the bumper to work with the CJ-6 though. The frame rails are the same width between the CJ-6 and the CJ-7, but the bolt lay out is a bit different. These differences would be the same for any '72-'76 CJ vs any '77-'86 CJ. One of the bolts in the side is in a different place, so I drilled both sides of the bumper/winch mount for the new location. The other difference was with the way the steering box attaches. The RockWare bumper sits low over the front cross member which works on the CJ-7, but on the '72-'76 CJs the steering box bracket has bolts through the top. These bolts hit on the bumper/winch mount and prevented it from going down far enough. To solve this problem, I used a small hole saw to cut out the top to provide space for the steering box bracket bolt heads.</p> <p>After the bumper/winch mount was attached, it was easy to bolt up the winch and run the cables to the battery. The winch saw a lot of action on a work trip out on Hacket Gulch. We were clearing up a bunch of dead fall and blocking off illegal trails and I had to winch several times pulling dead trees out of the forest. The whole system worked well even with the stock alternator and one battery.

A do it yourself type of Jeeper who is good at finding cheap used parts should be able to do this gear swap for a fraction of the cost of switching from 3.54 to 4.56 axle gears, but in low range it has nearly the same results as going to 4.56 gears. Swapping only transfer case gears also leaves high range the same for good freeway cruising.</p>"},{"location":"xfer/upgrades/d300ub/","title":"Jeep CJ Dana 300 Transfer Case U-Bolt Upgrade","text":"<p>The Dana 300 was used in CJs from 1980 until 1986 is probably the best all around transfer available in the CJ. It features a heavy duty cast iron case, gear drive, and a respectable 2.62:1 low. It shares a flexible input pattern that is used with many of the modern transfer cases of today and it's helical cut gears operate quietly. There are always ways of improving a good thing though, fortunately for the Dana 300, the improvement is easy and fairly inexpensive.</p> <p>The only mistake Jeep made putting the Dana 300 in the CJ was by changing from U-bolt yokes used on the Dana 20 to strap type yokes. The straps tend to loosen and break easier than the U-bolt yokes. Converting the Dana 300 to U-bolt yokes doesn't cost too much and it requires only a few common tools. The tools required include:</p> <ul> <li>1/4\" 12 pt. socket and socket wrench to remove strap bolts.</li> <li>1 1/8\" socket and socket wrench to turn it. This is needed to remove and replace the yoke retaining nut.</li> <li>18\" pipe wrench or other wrench large enough to clamp on to the yoke.</li> <li>1/2\" open end wrench to tighten U-bolts.</li> <li>Torque wrench to tighten retaining nut.</li> </ul> <p>I've heard that the yokes from a Dana 20 will fit on the Dana 300, so if you have a Dana 20 with decent U-bolt yokes or if you can find one in the core pile at your local yard, you might save some money. I just went out and bought new yokes since I didn't have a Dana 20. Part of the motivation for this project was to replace a bad yoke that had been damaged and no longer held the u-joint firmly causing some driveline vibration. I ordered two yokes (Spicer part 2-4-2461X) and two U-bolt kits (Spicer part 2-94-28X). When I installed the yoke on the front output, I found that the flange protecting the seal was too large. I hammered it off and used the flange from the old yoke. There probably is a part that will perfectly replace the front yoke, but I do not know the part number.</p> <p>Here is the step-by-step process of replacing the yokes:</p> <ol> <li>Block tires so your Jeep doesn't roll away.</li> <li>Remove the driveshafts with 1/4\" 12 pt. socket</li> <li>Hold the old yoke with the pipe wrench while removing the yoke retaining nut with 1 1/8\" socket.</li> <li>Remove old yoke and slide on new yoke.</li> <li>Hold new yoke with pipe wrench while tightening yoke retaining nut to 120 ft/lbs (162 N/M)</li> <li>Reinstall drive shafts with U-bolts and tighten with 1/2\" wrench.</li> </ol> <p>I did the rear first and then removed the skid plate/cross member to do the front, after properly supporting the transmission of course. I think that the yoke retaining nuts should technically be replaced since they are locking nuts, but I reused mine with no problems. Check out the article Jeep Axle U-Bolt Yoke Upgrade for information about upgrading your axle yokes.</p>"},{"location":"xfer/upgrades/scout300/","title":"The Scout Dana 300","text":"<p>What's so special about a Scout Dana 300? Well many things make it desirable including:</p> <ul> <li>The \"Texas\" bolt pattern</li> <li>The 2.62 low range</li> <li>Rear center output</li> <li>Sturdy construction</li> <li>Short transmission adapter</li> </ul> <p>The \"Texas\" bolt pattern is the pattern on the input side which is the same pattern used on the Dana 20 and Dana 18. The only difference is on the Scout Dana 300, the bottom bolt is not used, only the four bolts on the side are used. Since it features this pattern, it is bolt compatible with any Jeep or Scout transmission that has a Dana 20 or Dana 18 attached to it.</p> <p>The Scout Dana 300 features a 2.62:1 low range just like the Jeep Dana 300. This is a big improvement over the the 2.03:1 low range of the Dana 20. If it doesn't sound like much difference to you, remember that gears are multiplicative. If have a Jeep T-18/Dana 20/3.54s combination for example, your crawl ratio is 6.32 * 2.03 * 3.54 or 45:1. If a Scout 300 was swapped in, the crawl ratio would be 6.32 * 2.62 * 3.54 or 59:1. The same would be true if you were running a wide ratio Scout T-19. Keep in mind that all Scout T-18s, some Scout T-19s, and some Jeep T-18s were close ratio.</p> <p>The Scout Dana 300 also has a center output which is transfers power straight through in two wheel drive high mode. The down side of this over an offset rear output like the Dana 18, is that the rear drive shaft angle is somewhat steeper. The good side is since the center output is straight through in 2H, it is quieter and longer lasting.</p> <p>Another feature of the Scout Dana 300 is it features the same sturdy construction as the Jeep Dana 300. The Scout 300 has a cast iron case and is gear driven. The only real difference between the Jeep and Scout Dana 300s is the input bolt pattern. The Scout Dana 300 also has a short rear tail housing like the early Jeep Dana 300s.</p> <p> You will not find a heavy duty drive train as short and low geared as a the Jeep T-18 and Scout Dana 300 combination. The Jeep T-18 used in late 70s CJs features a 6.32:1 first, short input shaft, and a transmission to transfer case adapter that is about 1\" long. The Scout Dana 300 bolts right up to the factory adapter as you can seen in this picture provided by Rick Boiros.

There are several difference that make the Scout Dana 300 unique including:</p> <ul> <li>The speedometer cable attaches on the passenger side</li> <li>Shallow oil pan</li> <li>Does not use bottom bolt</li> <li>Aluminum tail housing</li> <li>Aluminum shift tower</li> </ul> <p> Looking at the speedometer cable attachment point is the easiest thing to check. Only the Scout Dana 300 (painted blue) has the speedometer cable attach on the passenger side of the rear tail housing. The Scout and Jeep Dana 20s and Jeep Dana 300s have the speedometer cable attach on drivers side of the rear tail housing.</p> <p> This picture shows a Scout Dana 300 in blue and a Jeep Dana 20 which is rusty and dirty. It clearly shows the deep oil pan used in the Dana 20 vs. the shallow oil pan used on Dana 300s. The Jeep Dana 300 also uses a shallow oil pan. It also shows the missing lower bolt hole on the Scout Dana 300.</p> <p> From the top you can see the aluminum tail housing and shift tower of the Scout Dana 300. The Dana 20s use a cast iron tail housing and shift tower. Often it is hard to tell the material used when for these parts when crawling under a truck, so this feature is probably the least useful identifying feature.</p> <p>Jeep T-18 and Scout Dana 300</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"xfer/upgrades/ih/ihd300id/#swaps","title":"Swaps","text":"<p>Swapping in the Scout Dana 300: General information on swapping in the 1980 Scout II Dana 300 into a Jeep vehicle.</p>"}]}
