Larger tires gain ground clearance, increase maximum fording depth, and increase the angles of departure and approach, but they often don't work well with OEM gearing. Auto manufactures build trucks for the street, which means they select high gearing for fast acceleration and better gas mileage. When larger tires are put on these trucks, the driver may find themselves burning through clutches because first gear is so high. Engine performance and gas milage may suffer because the engine is forced to work outside of it's optimal RPM ranges. Top speed on the highway will increase, but so will low speed on the trail.</p> <p>There are two main motivations to regear, the first is to return the truck to the manufactures operating ranges to improve engine performance and decrease wear and tear on the clutch and transmission. The second is to increase off-road performance with lower gearing. Lower gearing allows the off-roader to go slower through obstacles giving the driver better control so there is less chance of vehicle damage and occupant injury. There is a penalty for low gears on top highway cruising speed. The gear and tire form is designed to allow the user to try different configurations and see what performance will be like for different configurations before going through an expensive gear swap.</p>"},{"location":"applications/gear/#general-information-on-gear-ratios","title":"General Information on Gear Ratios","text":"<p>One important aspect of gear ratios is numerically large gears are the low ones. Gear ratios are normally stated in the form x.xx:1, e.g. 6.32:1. This translates mathematically to 1/6.32, and since 1/2 is more than 1/6, 6:1 is lower than 2:1. The ratio means that for every 6.32 revolutions from the input the output will rotate once. This happens to be granny low first gear on a Ford T-18 transmission. When you are in first with the T-18, the engine does 6.32 revolutions for every 1 revolution the transmissions outputs. Fourth gear on the T-18 is 1.00:1, so for every revolution of the engine, it outputs one revolution.</p>"},{"location":"applications/gear/#input-for-the-gear-and-tire-applet","title":"Input for the Gear and Tire Applet","text":"<p>The Gear and Tire Applet takes as input your tire size, transmission ratios, transfer case low range, and ring and pinion.</p> <p>The tire field will accept input in English or metric sizes. The entire metric size must be input to calculate diameter, but the prefix 'P' or 'LT' are optional. For example the tire size P225/75R15 could be entered without the 'P'. For English sizes, the gear and tire form is only interested in the diameter in inches. The rest is not needed, but if it is typed it will be ignored. For example '32x11.50R15LT M+S' can be just entered 32.</p> <p>Input of Transmission ratios, transfer case low range, and ring and pinion all have the same basic form.

The graph is a line graph with RPM on the x-axis ranging from 0 to 4000 RPM. The y-axis is either MPH or KPH depending on user input. MPH range from 0 to 80 MPH. KPH range from 0 to 120 KPH. Each transmission gear is printed out as a separate line in the graph first being red, second blue, third green, fourth black, and fifth yellow. A check box at the bottom of the graph allows the user to \"shift\" the transfer case into low range. The title of the graph gives the users tire size and ring and pinion ratio.</p> <p>The tabular output is also produced each time the calculate button is pressed. The title on the tabular output indicates the units of output either KPH or MPH. It also indicates the users selection of tire and ring and pinion and allows the user to enter different RPMs to see the table at various engine outputs. Each row of the table represents a gear of the transmission first, second, third and so forth. The columns represent high and low range of the transfer case.</p> <p>The crawl ratio, which is often used to compare gearing set ups, is also included in the tabular output. The crawl ratio represents compound low, or first gear of the transmission and low range of the transfer case. For example, many Wranglers have a first gear around 3.83:1, the transfer case low range is 2.72:1, and the axle ring and pinion is 3.07:1. This means the crawl ratio is 3.832.723.07 or around 32:1.

It takes three of these components to calculate the diameter of the tire. It sure is not a very straight forward sizing convention.</p> <p>The prefix is used to indicate general use of the tire. The tire input field trys to ignore the prefix and if your prefix causes an error, just don't input it. The Gear and Tire Applet currently will successfully ignore 'P' for passenger car and 'LT' for light truck. When in doubt, drop the prefix.</p> <p>The width simply the width of the tire in mm. For example the tire size P215/75R15 has a width of 215mm.</p> <p>The next component is the aspect ratio. The aspect ratio is the percentage of the width that makes up the sidewall of the tire. In the above example the aspect ratio is 75 or 75%, so the sidewall height is 75% of 215 or 161.25mm. If you want the diameter of the tire, you need to take into account that the diameter of the tire passes two sections of the side wall. This means the sidewall takes up 161.25*2 or 322.5mm of the diameter.</p> <p>The next component is the wheel size. In the above example the wheel size is 15\". If you convert the total sidewall into inches you get 322.5mm*0.03937in/mm or about 12.7\". Add that to wheel size and you get the diameter 15\"+12.7\" is 27.7\".

To calculate the circumference of a circle the Gear and Tire Applet uses the classic formula 2(pi)r, or given the diameter it is simply the diameter times pi. This means in the above example a 27.7\" tire has a circumference of 27.7(pi) or around 87\". Every time the tire rotates once, the vehicle travels 87\". This can be converted to miles or kilometers for calculations of speed given the number of engine revolutions per hour. Anyway looking at the simple formula d(pi) it is clear that a larger tire travels further for each revolutions since it has bigger circumferences. That is why when larger tires are swapped in, you go faster.</p>"},{"location":"applications/gear/#transmissions","title":"Transmissions","text":"<p>The Gear and Tire Applet allows you to enter up to five speeds and a reverse gear ratio.

The pinion takes input from the driveshaft and turns the ring. The ring spins the differential which turns the axle shafts. There are a fairly wide variety of ring and pinions ratios available anywhere from 2.73:1 to 6.50:1 depending on the model of the axle. Since transmission and transfer case ratios are fairly set, a change of ring and pinion is the easiest and least expensive way to modify the gearing of your 4x4.</p> <p>Figuring out what ratio ring and pinion you have is not always easy. Depending on engine, transmission, and option package the manufacturer may have used any one of several ratios. The easiest way is to locate and try to read the tag on on the differential housing. Sometimes this tag is located on the differential housing cover, sometimes it is not. It may be a a code stamped in the housing that needs to be looked up in your technical service manual.</p> <p>One sure fire way of determining your ratio is opening up the axle and taking a look. Often the ring is stamped with tooth count, ratio, and build date. Sometimes it isn't stamped, but you can still count the teeth yourself and divide ring teeth by pinion teeth to get the ratio.</p> <p>An easier, but not as accurate method of determining your ratio is to jack one wheel off the ground and count the number of drive shaft rotations it takes to turn the tire one full rotation. Multiply this number by two and that is your ratio. If you have a looking or limited slip differential, you may find it difficult to rotate the tire by hand. If this is the case lift both tires off the ground and support the vehicle with jack stands to count rotations for one rotation of both tires.</p> <p>One final note on ring and pinion, if you know the ratio of one axle the other should be the same give or take a few hundredths.

Sometimes, these modifications make speedometer recalibration necessary. Any change in the ring and pinion or tire size can throw off the speedometer. The simple way to calculate the proper speedometer driven gear is by setting up a ratio. The ratio should look like this:</p> <pre><code>newGear * newTire = oldGear * oldTire\n\nor\n\nnewGear/newRingAndPinion = oldGear/oldRingAndPinion\n</code></pre> <p>Solve this ratio for newGear to determine the proper tooth count for the speedometer gear. For example, if you had 225/75R15 tires (approximately 28.2\" in diameter) and you swap in 33s, you would set up the following ratio:</p> <pre><code>newGear * 33 = 27 * 28.2\n\nnewGear = (27*28.2) / 33\n\nnewGear = 23.07  (23 tooth gear)\n</code></pre> <p>The calculation for a ring and pinion swap from 2.73:1 to 4.27:1 would look like:</p> <pre><code>newGear/4.27 = 27/2.73\n\nnewGear = (27/2.73) * 4.27\n\nnewGear = 42.23 (42 tooth gear)\n</code></pre> <p>Determining the old speedometer driven gear is very simple. All that needs to be done is remove the speedometer cable (typically with a pair of pliers) and remove the speedometer gear housing which is normally held in by one bolt or his threaded into the transfer case tail housing.

In the above example the aspect ratio is 75 or 75%, so the sidewall height is 75% of 215 or 161.25 mm. If you want the diameter of the tire, you need to take into account that the diameter of the tire passes two sections of the side wall.

The bearing is retained by the backing plate of the brakes that is bolted to the axle housing. If the backing plate is removed, the shaft will slide right out. To remove a C-clip axle shaft, all that needs to be done is remove the C-clip.</p> <p>The C-clip axles are used in all Jeeps produced today except the models with the Dana 44 rear.

The ratio is an approximation of the number of turns of input for every one turn of output. This means that if you have 4.27:1 R&amp;P, the drive shaft must turn 4.27 times for every one revolution of both wheels. This means you'll be moving a lot slower in the same gear as someone with 2.73:1 R&amp;P. When you are off-road, lower gears (numerically high) allow you to take obstacles slower and the slower you'll go on steep decents. The slower you go, the more control you have and you are less likely to break something.</p> <p>So why are 4.27:1 axles lower than 2.73:1 axles you ask? Well, if you look at ratios as fractions, you will see that 1/4.27 is less than 1/2.73. That is like saying 1/4 is less than 1/3.</p> <p>The way the ratios are calculated is by dividing the number of teeth on the ring gear by the number of teeth on the pinion gear.

If R&amp;P came in a 10 tooth pinion gear and a 40 tooth ring gear, the same 10 teeth would be hitting the same teeth on the ring gear every revolution. If an odd ratio is chosen, the teeth are meshing with different teeth all the time and no regular wear pattern develops.

When axles are built, there is normally a tag bolted to the differential cover or a code stamped on the differential housing. The tag may have the ratio specified or it may have the tooth count specified. All of the newer axles specify the ratio and some other build information on the tag. For example, you will likely find \"3.07\" on a Wrangler axle tag as well as other build codes.</p> <p>If either the front or rear ratio can be determined, you can be pretty sure the other axle contains the same ratio.

You know how the saying goes \"Only in a jeep\", I think it should be \"only to a jeep (must you replace everything)\" :)</p> <p>Ok, here is the basic project: I got a 78 Scout's Dana 44s for $200 and threw them under my jeep. The rear took about 4 hours total, just torch the spring perches off and reweld them over about 3/4\" each. The front however was a different story. The spring perches could not be moved over due to the diff. Housing occupying the necessary space. So the old spring hangers were unbolted on the front and drilled and cut on the rear (of the front springs). Then rewelded over about an inch and a quarter. Side braces were put on the front (rear) spring hangers, so a triangle extended from the frame. The front shackle was just bolted on to a piece of 1/4\" angle iron scrap that I got with the scout front springs (I didn't end up using the scout's springs). Also, the front drive shaft had to be shorted an inch.</p> <p>The other real headache was the steering gear swap. I looked at a few junkyards before I found one that looked like it would work right as far as mounts and that wasn't as loose as mine. I ended up with one from an old olds. Delta 88. I didn't get an excellent deal on it at $75, but the guy threw in the pump, hoses, steering shaft, and pitman. The steering shaft turned out to be most useful. NOTE: (it has been said before) the U-joints in the steering shaft are also a major culprit in the loose steering equation.</p> <p>Anyway, the delta 88 steering shaft was cutover and the Jeeps pounded apart and the two slid together (using the Delta 88's lower section and Jeeps upper section). The telescoping (safety) part of the stock Jeep was kept (at full extended length). The completed (fabricated) rod was welded together. The steering gear itself bolted right in, although it was only a three bolt, instead of 4.</p> <p>Overall conclusions: Well, the front was a real pain in the rear. In retro though maybe I would have tried to see how long I could have gone without breaking the stock dana 30 before going to the scout's big dana 44. Every tire does stick out about an inch more that stock. Backspacing to over come this looks impossible, at least with 15\" wheels.

No one has ever written a guide to help you do it yourself (at least not that I know of). Because of this, I wasn't sure I'd be able to do the job myself. Among the rumors I had heard were that:</p> <ul> <li>I would need a 50-ton press to get the old tubing out of the knuckle.</li> <li>I would never get the geometry right</li> <li>Do you really think you can do something yourself that shops need ten of thousand dollars worth of equipment to do?</li> </ul> <p>Here's what I did and how I did it.</p> <p>I started with an axle housing from a narrow track '78 Cherokee and knowledge I gained from the Jeep tech list and members of my club. I lucked into getting the complete front end for $40, so I wasn't too worried about ruining it.</p> <p>The first thing I did was to set the Dana 44 in front of my Jeep and start measuring. The spring pads were about 32 inches apart, 4 inches wider than my CJ. The overall length was around 61 inches from wheel mounting surface to wheel mounting surface and my CJ wide-track front end was 56 inches. The distance from the spring pads to the wheel mounting surface was pretty close to my CJ, so I reasoned that I could leave the short side alone and shorten the long side about 4 inches. This agreed with everything I had read on Jeep-tech, so I decided to go ahead with it.</p> <p>I also checked caster and pinion angles. My CJ had about 0 degrees of caster, the spring pads were parallel with the floor and the pinion was about 5 degrees up relative to the floor. This isn't the standard way of measuring pinion angle, I was just trying to measure the relative angle between the spring pads and pinion angle, so I could duplicate it on the new front end. Then I measured it out on the Dana 44 front end. With the spring pads parallel to the floor, the pinion was 12 degrees up and the caster was at 0 degrees. This is a great thing, it meant I could cut 7 degrees out of the cast in the spring pad on the housing, the other spring pad has to be moved anyway. The result would be a pinion angle of 5 degrees up (relative to the floor) and 7 degrees of caster without cutting and turning the inner knuckle on the short side.</p> <p></p> <p>The first step was to remove the brakes, rotors, spindles and outer knuckles, shafts, and differential carrier. This is all well-documented elsewhere, so I won't go into detail here. I stripped it down to the bare housing except I left the pinion in (no reason, I just didn't feel like removing it). Next I used a 4\" grinder to remove the spring perch and shock mount from the long axle tube. I gouged the tube a bit in doing this so I welded up the gouges and ground them smooth again.</p> <p>Next, I re-cut the spring perch cast into the center section to give me the proper pinion angle. I had to take off more than 1/4\" of metal at one end and taper down to none removed at the other. I started by setting the axle on jack stands with a third jack stand under the pinion. I carefully adjusted and shimmed the jack stand under the pinion until I had the housing positioned just right. I set it up so that the final pad angle would be correct if I held the grinder level. I installed a new wheel on the grinder and started at the thick end. I pushed the grinder across using the edge to cut away the metal, stopping to check the angle several times. Eventually I was finished. The spring pad looks great and is perfectly flat. I am very pleased with the results, although it did take a long time and I went through three grinding wheels.</p> <p> The next step was the actual cutting of the tube. I brought the housing down to my friend Tim Norstad's house because he has a chop saw and is always generous with his tools. I had already measured and marked the tubing at home. This is not difficult, just remember that the tube sticks into the inner knuckle a bit, so don't cut the tubing off at 4\" away from the knuckle. I'm not going to give an actual measurement here because I'm not positive everyone's axle housing will be identical to mine. I purposely cut my tubing about 1/8\" short in case I decided to weld where the end of the tube meets the knuckle. The tubing wasn't any more difficult to cut than any other piece of metal that size. After the tube was cut to size, I had a short piece of tube still attached to the inner knuckle. Tim and I cut that tube off as close to the knuckle as possible.</p> <p>When I got home, I clamped the inner knuckle in my vice and started grinding off the bead and old tube where it attached to the knuckle. The guys in my club said to grind until I just started to see a line or crack between the tube and the knuckle. Their next suggestion was to press out the old tube with a hydraulic press. I don't have a press so I tried hammering it with a 3 lb hammer and punch. This did nothing. Then I put the knuckle back in the vice, took my hacksaw apart and put the blade through the center and reconnected it. I made two cuts about 90 degrees apart and then easily drove out the pieces of tubing one at a time.</p> <p>This left me with a free outer knuckle and a tube it needed to go on. I had heard that I would definitely need a press for this part but I had done it all myself so far, I wasn't going to stop here without at least trying. I cleaned the rust and weld splatter off the tube and ground a small bevel all the way around the edge. Next I started tapping the knuckle on with a 1 lb ball peen hammer. It was working. I had to hit it hard, but not so hard I was worried about bending breaking anything.</p> <p>After the outer knuckle was on 1/2\" I stopped and set the caster. To do this I set the housing up on jack stands again, this time I set it so that the surface for the nut of the lower ball joint on the still attached knuckle was level. Then I tapped the free knuckle until it matched. From here I drove it on the rest of the way, stopping may time to measure. After I had it in place I spent 2 hours with a tape measure and angle finder making sure everything was right. I tack welded it and let it sit for a week before I spent another hour measuring again.</p> <p></p> <p>The only thing left was to weld the knuckle on. If you aren't sure about your welding skills or your welder doesn't have a high enough amp rating it would be best to leave it to a professional welder. One important note is that the weld doesn't carry the weight of the vehicle because the tubing sticks into the inner knuckle about an inch. I have heard of people butt welding the knuckle to the tube (they didn't remove the old tube from the knuckle, just cut it flush and rewelded). This sounds incredibly weak and dangerous to me, not to mention the difficulty of lining up the pieces. The fact that the tube is so far into the knuckle and such a tight fit in the knuckle gives me the confidence to know it is strong and lined up properly.</p> <p>I re-installed the outer knuckles, spindles and rotors to check out the front end. The actual distance from wheel mounting surface to wheel mounting surface is 57 inches. My wheels will stick out 1/2\" farther than they did before. All the angles check out right, and it looks like it should bolt in with no problems.</p> <p>What's left? I need to send the long side inner axle shaft in to be shortened. I need to weld the spring pad and shock mount for the long side back on. I need new ball joints and U-joints. I need to decide about the steering and brakes.</p> <p>There are many steering and brake options available to me by mixing and matching Jeep, Chevy, Ford and Scout II disc brake parts, so this won't be a problem. My current thought is to use the Cherokee outer knuckles, spindles and Chevy type brakes with F-150 rotors (F-150's have the same 5 on 5 1/2\" wheel bolt pattern as Jeep CJ's). There are two advantages to this: 1) I will get the stronger and less leaky internal type lockouts and 2) The Cherokee tie rod mounts on top of the knuckles and is much larger and stronger than a CJ tie rod.</p> <p>Another possibility is using my stock outer knuckles, spindles, brakes and steering with Scout II outer axle shafts. Scout II outer axle shafts use the Dana 44 sized U-joint but are otherwise similar to CJ outer shafts. Or I could use non-disc brake CJ outer knuckles with my stock steering, Cherokee spindles, Chevy type brakes and F-150 rotors and hubs or I could... The possibilities are limitless.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"axle/upgrades/sjd44true/","title":"True Trac install","text":"<p>by John Nutter</p> <p></p> <p>I had a good day at the swap meet yesterday, I bought a 3-series True Trac for a Dana 44 with reverse rotations 3.50 gears attached for $50. I need to change the gears because I'm going to install it in a standard rotation front Dana 44. The front Dana 44 axle is from a '78 Cherokee that I shortened to CJ specifications.</p> <p>The True Trac went in very easily, mainly because I don't have the front end installed yet. The hardest part was removing the open carrier. I wrapped a cable around it and hung it from the ceiling to preload it while I pried on one of the ring gear bolts. The FSM doesn't say anything about hanging the whole axle from the ceiling by the carrier, but I don't have a case spreader. Either way it worked out. The FSM does say to pry on the case itself and the heads on the ring gear bolts to remove the carrier.</p> <p>After that I finally found my air impact wrench (and the trigger that had broken off it and migrated to the back of a drawer) and situated the Jeep, so I could run it and use the on-board air. The ring gear bolts came out very easily with the air impact.</p> <p>With the ring gear off, I dropped the True Trac into the housing and snugged it down to see how the bearing preload would be with the bearings and shims that came on the True Trac. It felt about right, so I decided to see how the backlash and gear pattern were with those bearings.</p> <p>Next I swapped the standard cut ring gear over to the true trac and pulled it uptight slowly and evenly with a ratchet. After it was good and tight, I applied lock tight to the bolts and snugged them up again. I couldn't figure out a way to hold the carrier for the final tightening (there are no holes in the sides of a True Trac to stick a pry bar into), so I used the air impact.</p> <p>After it was assembled, I set the carrier in the housing and slowly turned the bolts for the bearing caps to pull it down. I went in a chris cross pattern, about 1/2 a turn at a time. Once it was down, I checked the backlash and gear pattern. Amazingly, it was like I hadn't disturbed anything. Both were unchanged from before. The only thing that was different was slightly less bearing preload on the carrier, which is good because I think I had too much before. It now feels like it should.</p> <p>I saved the best for last, here's what I think I've learned from playing with the axles. I could be wrong on any of it, but this is how it's worked out for me:</p> <p>The pinion depth shims seem to go with the pinion. The carrier shims seem to go with the carrier. Meaning that if you are going to change a gear set that is already set up into another housing, try the shims from the original setup, rather than the ones that went with the housing. So far that's worked almost perfectly every time for me. If you are going to change from an open carrier to a different carrier that's already set up, try the shims that are already on the carrier. If you are going to a brand-new carrier, I'd try the shims from your old carrier first.

Most people probably have some kind of spacer laying around that will work, or you can buy a wheel bearing race driver set and use one of the driver pucks for the spacer ($20 to $40). You put the bearing separator on the carrier bearing, put the puller on that and tighten it down until the bearing comes off.

Although I did not do a spring over conversion at the time of my axle swap, incorporating one would be possible. If you are planning on an SOA set up in a YJ, swapping in larger axles is an excellent idea especially considering that most SOA Jeeps I've seen are running 35 inch tires. After seeing the size difference in components, as well as the \"effectiveness\" of C clip axles, I would make the removal of the Dana 35C a must in an SOA conversion.</p> <p>Why swap to Dana 44s? The Dana 44s are significantly stronger than the stock YJ axles in all ways including shaft diameter, shaft spline count, ring and pinion size and axle housing size. Getting rid of the Dana 35C is one of the best things you can do to a Chrysler Jeep.</p> <p>Another advantage of swapping in a Dana 44 up front is it gives you something no YJ saw from the factory, manual hubs. Not just any hubs though, beefy 1/2 ton truck hubs. The tie rod is out of the way on top of the knuckles. The six lug wheel bolt pattern is stronger than the five and they look cool too.

The narrow track Wagoneer and Cherokee Jeeps lacked extensions on the fenders. You will find both right, and left hand drop differentials on these axles. The stock YJ has the diff on the driver's side. If you are keeping your original transfer case, a compatible front end must be found.</p> <p>When I performed my swap I opted to install the venerable Atlas II transfer case. If one wishes to incorporate a D300 transfer case into the swap, and get rid of the NP231, now is decision time. The CJs had diffs on the passenger side. Benefits include: longer drive shaft, GEARED Tcase, and IMO a better unit than the 231. As mentioned I did not install the D300. If you are interested in swapping in a Dana 300, check out the Scout Dana 300 conversion information.</p> <p>It wasn't until 1974 when Cherokees and Wagoneers started using the open knuckle Dana 44 that makes good swap material.

Next, put down a layer or three of masking tape over the area you plan to cut to protect the paint and to make it easier to draw a line.</p> <p>The front of the fender will require some imagination and what you cut will depend on personal taste.

You can cut your bumper really short like Mark did, or you can leave some. The easy way to tell the maximum amount of bumper to leave is by turning the wheel to the stop and taking a straight edge along the outside edge of the tire. Chop the bumper along this plane.

Eventually, this rust will become severe and the rear spring hanger will rip off, especially under hard use. Fixing this problem is not as hard or expensive as you might think.</p> <p>The great thing about '76-'86 CJs is the fully boxed frame. The frame is the strongest frame ever used in a CJ, great for four wheeling. One problem with it is the part above the rear spring hanger tends to collect dirt and moisture and eventually rust out. You'll notice most CJs of this vintage have suffered some damage in this area.</p> <p>After a trip to Lower Chinamen's Gulch, I noticed that familiar creaking sound when accelerating and braking that meant I'd cracked my frame and my spring hanger was about to rip off. I knew the sound because early in the year I ripped off a spring hanger after the Winter Meeting in Las Cruces. The fix I made last time was easy and cheap and it had survived a couple runs on Holy Cross and the trails of Moab. This time I decided to take some pictures.</p> <p>The fix only requires access to a welder, circular hand saw, air cut-off wheel, and drill. Instead of welding new metal to the frame, I bolted the repair to the frame using existing holes in the frame. The advantage of bolting the repair to the frame is there is no need to remove the gas tank or tub. Since I have an oversize gas tank, there was no way I was going to be able to weld on the repair without removing the tank. Making the repair without removing the tank saved me a day of work.</p> <p>The following supplies were used to complete the project:</p> <ul> <li>2 - 1/2\"x1\" coarse grade 5 bolts with nuts</li> <li>2 - 5/8\"x4\" coarse grade 5 bolts with nuts and lock washers</li> <li>Scrap of 3/16\" plate</li> </ul> <p> Start by putting the rear end of the Jeep up on jack stands and removing the bolts holding on the spring hanger. As soon as I removed the spring hanger, I could see the crack running along the boxing weld and across the lower part of the outer channel. Using an air cut-off wheel, cut the rest of the bottom piece of the channel and removed all the damaged material around the cracks. After removing the damaged material and cleaning it with a wire brush, spray it down with a rust converting primer.</p> <p>While the primer was drying, cut three pieces of 3/16\" plate. Cut two pieces 2 5/8\" X 9\" for the sides and cut one piece for the bottom 6\" long and 3 1/4\"wide, tapering out to 5\". I tapered the bottom piece so it was wide enough to use as a frame tie in with my bumper in the future.</p> <p> Using a pair of vice grip clamps, clamp the inside plate and the bottom plate in place so that the bottom edge of the inside piece was flush with the bottom plate. Mark the inside piece with the two holes that already exist in the frame rail for drilling. Remove the inside plate and clamp on the outside plate so that the bottom edge of the plate is flush with the top of the bottom plate. Mark the outside plate for drilling and the bottom plate for the spring hanger.</p> <p> Remove the plates and drill the inside and outside plates with a 5/8\" drill. One of the frame holes on the inside frame channel may also need to be enlarged to 5/8\", the other three holes should already be 5/8\". Drill the bottom plate with a 1/2\" bit and bolt a spring hanger to the plate. Weld the nuts to the top of the bottom plate.</p> <p>Once the drilling is complete, the hard work is done. Bolt the inside and outside plates in place and clamp on the bottom plate. Tack weld the three plates together and remove the whole thing. Complete the welding on the floor so you can get a good even bead. Since my exhaust routes out the corner, I also welded two 3/8\"x1 1/2\" bolts on the outside plate to act as a heavy-duty exhaust hanger. Bolt everything back together and you are all done.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"body/heater/","title":"Jeep Heater Blower Motor Upgrade","text":"<p>The Chevy Blazer heater motor upgrade for Jeep CJs and Wranglers has been bouncing around the net for as long as I can remember.

Other than that, the tools in most peoples tool box and anyone capable of changing their oil should be able to do the upgrade.</p> <p>Start by draining at least 1/4 of the coolant from your radiator. It might be a good time to put in some fresh coolant. If so, check with local laws on how to properly dispose of your coolant. Do not pour it in a storm sewer. For most animals, drinking coolant causes kidney failure, not a pleasant way to go. Be sure to \"burp\" the system when you refill the coolant.</p> <p> I have a dual battery tray, so for me it was easier to remove the tray to get access to the hoses and wires going to the heater. If you have a stock tray, you might be able to leave it.</p> <p>Disconnect the two hoses on the engine side of the fire wall that go into the heater core. There should be a wire nearby that plugs into your current heater motor, unplug it. Also remove the curved drain hose that drains the bottom of the heater. You may also need to remove the hose that drains the grill on the cowl.</p> <p> I removed all the bolts from my dash and pulled it out a bit to get easier access to my heater housing. It is possible to remove the heater without removing the dash, but it makes it easier to see what you are doing and you don't have to contort yourself under the dash to remove cables and wires.</p> <p>Next, you need to unhook all the ventilation control cables and wires that attach to the heater housing behind the dash. Also disconnect the defroster duct hose at the top of heater housing.</p> <p>Remove the four nuts that secure the heater housing on the engine side of the firewall. Three of them are pretty obvious near the heater hoses and heater motor, the other is near the middle of the fire wall behind the valve cover on my 258.</p> <p>After the nuts are removed, you are ready to wrestle your heater housing out.  When you get the heater housing on the garage floor, remove the screws from the back of the housing that hold the housing together. There was caulking around the cover, so it took some gentle prying to pull it apart.</p> <p>Remove the old motor and take the fan off of it and install the fan on your new motor. The new motor should be installed with no modifications on the heater housing. You might want to bench test the motor at this time to make sure it works and the fan is attached properly.</p> <p>Now it is time to enlarge the hole in your fire wall to make room for the new motor. I opted to make an octagon shaped hole with an air cut off wheel. The hole is not as clean, but it took me no time to do. I originally planned on using a 3 1/4\" hole saw, but this would have required removing the front fender to get my drill in there. The hole saw would also require me to attach a sheet metal plate to the fire wall so the pilot bit could hold the hole saw in place. A saber saw would work well, but it would also most likely require removing the front fender. A metal hand saw, other than a bow type hack saw, would probably work to enlarge the hole. Rod Gramlich wrote up the procedure he used to enlarge the hole with a hole saw. Other people have reported using a die grinder from the inside.</p> <p>Once the hole is enlarged, it is time to put everything back together. Before you get everything back together, you might want to test the motor, or at least bench test it. Don't start your Jeep without coolant.</p> <p> The seal from my original heater motor didn't go around the new motor, so I sealed it with some black silicon RTV.

I have heard that not all the motors have this hole. Some motors come with a metal retaining clip to secure the motor from the outside, remove this clip.</p> <p> The larger heater motor interfered with my dual battery tray, so I had to cut a notch out of the tray to give the motor clearance.

A couple guys in the club had spare parts tire carriers where they would have entire front axle outers to hold on their spare tire. All of these were done on fabricated tire carriers, but I figured I could build one off the stock spare tire carrier. I thought about it a while and what I came up with was so simple, I wished I'd done it sooner. This modification could also be done easily to many after market spare tire carriers.</p> <p>I've seen some spare parts tire carriers that even have a knuckle on them, but I figured spindle out would be enough for me. The tricky part is providing a mounting surface for the spindle that is out far enough that you can bolt a tire to the brake hub and not so far out that the tire becomes a giant lever waiting for the correct pressure to rip off your tire carrier.</p> <p>The first thing I did was remove the stock tire carrier and grind, cut, and pound out the three bolts that hold on the spare. After removing the mounting bolts, I cut off the end right off where the two cross braces come from the top bar to the box (see top picture). I then removed the internal brace inside the box. I took the original end of the box and bent it a bit so it fit inside the now shortened box. I welded this in place, then I took a piece of sheet metal and welded it over the end of the box so I had a clean surface on the outside with no holes. Next I broke out a 3 1/2\" hole saw I purchased for the project and cut a hole in the sheet metal. I took a spindle for a spare Dana 30 and placed it in the hole and marked out the bolt holes. Drilled out the holes and blasted the whole thing with flat black spray paint.</p> <p>After it was dry, I took a spindle with short axle shaft and bolted it on with five 7/16\"X3/4\" bolts. I slid on a brake hub with bearing and secured it with two spindle nuts and locking washer. A spare hub went on next which holds the short shaft in place. I didn't put on a spare rotor, I figured it would just add weight. I put a bunch of washers behind the studs to make up for the room of the missing rotor.</p> <p>I took my creation and bolted to the Jeep and put on my spare tire a 33\"x12.5\" BFG MT. It could have been about 3/4\" closer, but it looked great. It is \"full floating\" too, which will surprise someone when the lean against it and it begins to spin.</p>"},{"location":"body/spare/#field-testing","title":"Field Testing","text":"<p>I got the my full floating spare tire carrier done just before my trip to Las Cruces for the Winter Meeting. I hadn't tested it yet off road, so I was a bit nervous about it. It survived The Gauntlet, Wolf Run, and Broad Canyon with no problems and received rave reviews from other four wheelers.</p> <p>When I was wheeling out in Moab a couple months later, I was coming down a real steep rock and managed to bend the entire carrier up. Probably if I used a 33\"x9.5\" tire for a spare, this wouldn't be a problem, but I was using a full size spare.</p> <p>A couple weeks later the carrier came in handy when I was wheeling in Farmington. A friend managed to break a lock-out and sheer all the studs of in the brake hub except for one. Rather than drill out all the studs, we just used the lock-out and brake hub from my spare parts carrier. Currently it is bent up and has a ruined brake hub on it, but it still holds my spare!</p> <p>Spare parts tire carrier II coming soon...</p> <p></p> <p>July 23, 1997</p>"},{"location":"body/tjflares/","title":"Installing TJ Flares on a CJ","text":"<p>by Don Barker </p> <p>Installing TJ flares on all four corners of my '82 CJ-7 allows me to run 35x14.5 Swamper SSR's with only a 4\" suspension lift and 1\" body lift. The TJ fender flares provide more clearance allowing me to run larger tires without damaging the body. Aftermarket TJ fender flares come in various widths so there is plenty of fender covering the tires. The TJ fender flare also uses an integrated marker light that keeps my Jeep street legal even though I trimmed the fenders.</p>"},{"location":"body/tjflares/#front-wheel-well","title":"Front Wheel Well","text":"<p>The good part about using YJ or TJ front flares on a CJ is that the Wrangler front fenders are about 1 1/2\" longer than CJ front fender flares. The extra two inches in length on a Wrangler fender is located forward of the wheel well. This allows you to line up a Wrangler flare on a CJ fender with extra room in the back of the wheel well. The back of the front fender is where you will hit first with a big tire. The general shape of a Wrangler rear flare also gives you more room in the rear wheel well.</p> <p></p> <p>In the photos note where the rear of the front flare is with respect to the vertical body seam between the body and the metal fender. The TJ flare at the bottom of the rocker panel intersects this seam line. The CJ flare is a good 4-6\" forward of this seam. Also notice that the TJ flare is mounted higher on the fender than the CJ flare. This is not as easy to see in this photo, but it makes a big difference.</p> <p>Now comes the point of no return. Get out the saber saw and buy a new metal blade with 18-24 teeth per inch. I also found that hand tin snips were useful for some of the final trimming. You have to get yourself in the right frame of mind to cut your fenders, but once you do the job is really easy.</p> <p>Place the front flare up against the fender and adjust back and forth, up and down, until you fully understand where it is going to be located. Mark the body with a wax-marking pen so you know where the flare is to be located. You will be first cutting off the complete raised ridge, about a 1\" wide strip, around the entire wheel well except leaving some material at the front of the fender for mounting the flare. YJ and TJ fenders need a flat mounting surface plus this gives you more room. You will be cutting the rear of the wheel well opening flush with the wheel well liner. You can stop here and mount the flares, but it is easy to get much more room.</p> <p>I then carefully separated the wheel well liner from the fender along the entire rear seam. These are just spot welds. Drive a screwdriver into the seam to open it up and find the spot welds. I then took my sawzall, slipped the blade into the opened seam and cut through each spot weld. Obviously, the supports from the firewall to the wheel well liner need to be removed. (So far I have not replaced them and have been running this way for several months). I now made a vertical cut about two inches behind the shock going from the bottom of the wheel well liner up where it starts to bend over to form the top of the wheel well. This cut allows the complete rear of the wheel well liner to be pushed back. I pushed the rear of the wheel well back about 2 1/2 to 3\" as measured at the bottom of the saw cut. I then just pop-riveted a triangular strip of metal over this opening. Be careful that the final shape of the wheel well liner stays inside the frame rails, otherwise the tires will chew it up when you are turning. You will find that the charcoal canister on the drivers side will need to be relocated, the liner will come very close to the steering shaft, and the clearance for the clutch linkage may need to be accounted for.</p> <p>The passenger's side is a breeze and there are no interference problems unless you are still using the stock jack or running a big battery tray. The fender sheet metal at the rear of the wheel well was bent over 90 degrees to lay against the new wheel well liner. I made a couple of cuts so I was only bending a section about 3-4\" long at a time. (I'm not a body man.) This was pop-riveted to the liner and adds a fair amount of support to the liner since the fender is double thickness in this location. Obviously everything was carefully painted and sealed to prevent rust.</p> <p>The following two comparison pictures show that the leading edge of the TJ flare does not mate as nice as the CJ flare. The top front of the CJ fender has a more gradual bend downward than the Wrangler fenders. This can be seen in the photo showing the TJ flare and the fact that it does not mate perfectly to the fender in the front. Only trained eyes will note this area. Careful working of the CJ fender, particularly the raised ridge along the wheel well will minimize flaws in the fit in this region. The photos also show how much higher the TJ flare can be mounted compared to the CJ flare.</p> <p> </p> <p>Details of front corner of the flares.</p>"},{"location":"body/tjflares/#rear-wheel-well","title":"Rear Wheel Well","text":"<p> The rear wheel well is trivial compared to the front. The YJ or TJ flare will allow you to trim the sheet metal away from the front and back lower corners of the rear wheel well due to the general shape of the flare. This has helped most people since they hit the back edge first. The TJ rear flare has the same general shape as the YJ flare, but it can be mounted higher than the YJ flare. My rear TJ flare is mounted in the same position (height wise) as a CJ or YJ flare. There is over and inch of flare sticking out below the lower edge of the body, i.e., I could have mounted the flare at least an inch higher on the body. I didn't mount the flare higher since you don't hit the top of the rear wheel well and the bottom opening is monstrous.</p> <p> With only minor sheet metal cutting I have opened up the rear lip enough to clear my tires. Note: on the rear you are limited on the amount of opening you can do. The front of the rear wheel well defines the interior of the jeep and where the roll bar mounts. There is a lip you can trim off on the inside of the wheel well to gain about 1/2\" and there is body sheet metal that can be opened up. Any more is major work. The rear of the wheel well is limited by a bent panel, but there is ample room to trim body sheet metal.

A great way to become unpopular is to get stuck in a big mud pit without tow hooks. Many 4x4 events require that vehicles have tow hooks to participate in trail rides. If you drive a Jeep Wrangler YJ, you'll find the common $10 hooks won't bolt on and the hooks from the dealership retail for over $60 USD. Some suppliers have started selling a less expensive hook that fits the stock holes on a Wrangler, but these hooks are not available in all areas. The high cost of OEM tow hooks and the desire to have tow hooks as well as a winch inspired Dave Moulton and Kirk Beasley to come up with this inexpensive way to mount common tow hooks on Jeep Wranglers and CJs.</p> <p></p> <p>The use of this tow hook bracket allows you to mount standard tow hooks without drilling your frame. It also allows you to easily have tow hooks even with a winch mounted up front. The angle iron can replace the 1/4\" spacer that goes between the winch plate and frame brackets. The hooks can be mounted outboard, rather than inboard like Dave's hooks.</p> <p> Here's a shot of the hook and the angle iron. The two washers are the spacers from the winch mount kit that the angle iron replaces.  From the front, you can see how the angle iron fits between the two brackets of the winch mount on Kirks's CJ.</p> <p>To add your own bracket-mounted tow hooks, you will need:</p> <ul> <li>Standard tow hooks that you should be able to purchase for around $10 with bolts.</li> <li>About 1 foot of 2 1/2\" to 3\" angle iron 1/4\" thick.</li> <li>Two 1/2\" x 1 1/2\" grade 5 bolts (angle iron to frame).</li> <li>Two 1/2\" x 2\" grade 5 bolts (angle iron to hook).</li> <li>Two 1/2\" grade 5 nuts.</li> <li>Four 1/2\" lock washers</li> <li>Fourteen 1/2\" flat washers, 7 on each side</li> <li>A saw for cutting metal, a circular saw with metal cutting blade works well.</li> <li>A drill and a 1/2\" drill bit</li> <li>Utility knife.</li> <li>Safety goggles.</li> </ul> <p>Most of the supplies you should be able to get at your local hardware store. You may be able to find the angle iron used at your local iron yard. Used iron sells around here for $0.18 a pound, so this piece should cost next to nothing.</p> <p>All that you need to do is cut the angle iron to length and drill each piece for the tow hooks on one side and for the factory tow hook mounts on the other. Dave used a 2\"x3\"x6\"x.25\" piece of angle iron with the long side up, while Kirk reports using a 2\"x2\"x5.5\"x.25\" piece of angle iron. You may need to trim the plastic cover plate away with a utility knife to expose the rear mount hole, the front hole mounts through the top bumper bolt. Use the flat washers to fill in the space under the angle iron on the rear mount hole. Bolt everything down and torque to spec.</p> <p>When you use your tow hooks, always make sure that everyone is clear. If a tow hook breaks loose, it can become a deadly projectile!</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"body/york/","title":"On-Board Air for Jeeps Using the York Compressor","text":"<p>by Obi-Wan</p> <p></p> <p>One of the most time-honored rituals in four-wheeling is the airing down of your tires before you hit the trail. The problem is that you then need to refill them to street pressure before you hit the highway. The obvious solution is to carry an air tank or air compressor with you on the trail. There are several ways to do this:</p> <ul> <li>Carry a pre-filled air tank with you that has enough capacity to fill all four tires. This gives you a limited air supply and doesn't allow you to help out your neighbors who need air.</li> <li>Carry a $15 compressor powered by your lighter jack. This is inexpensive and gives you unlimited air, but you have to wait forever. I have such a compressor. It's great for bikes and balls, but it only puts about 1 psi per minute into my 225/75R15's.</li> <li>If you have ARB air lockers, you can use the small compressor that powers those to fill your tires. It is better than the above option, but it's still slow, noisy, only puts out about 90 psi, and costs $200.</li> <li>Companies like Curry and Ready-Air sell electric compressors that you mount in your engine compartment. These often are set up to fill auxiliary air tanks mounted somewhere on the vehicle. The Quick Air 2 boasts 2.2 cfm at 105 psi and runs about $250.</li> <li>The York-style A/C compressors used by AMC, Ford and Volvo in the '70's can be used as engine-driven air compressors. That's the setup that I'm using on my YJ. Not only will it fill tires, but it also keeps up with most smaller air tools.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"body/york/#the-tank","title":"The Tank","text":"<p>You really should have a tank for any good onboard air setup. This ensures that you still have air if your engine dies, and it lets you run things like air tools that suck use volume than your compressor can put out.</p> <p>Some people weld shut the ends of their tube bumpers, nerf bars, or roll cages and tap a hole to mount the air fittings. For example, a 36\" long, 3\" diameter tube will hold 1.1 gallons of air. This is a great idea, if you have such things on your vehicle. I don't (yet). I opted for a used 6\"x19\", 2-gallon tank from an old portable air compressor rated at 125 psi. I picked this up at a local air compressor repair shop for $30. It even came with the necessary brackets already welded onto it, as well as two threaded holes containing a drain plug, quick disconnect fitting, and 150 psi pop-off safety valve. I just had to drill the mounting holes and cut off any brackets I didn't need.  </p> <p>The next trick is tank placement. Some people put the tank inside the vehicle, but then you have to run the air lines through the firewall to reach the compressor. It's also a safety hazard if the tank gets over-pressurized or dented and explodes. In a small vehicle like my YJ, inside space is at a premium, so I didn't want to waste it with a permanently-mounted air tank.</p> <p>That left three good spots that I could find on my YJ:</p> <ol> <li>Just behind and to the right (passenger side) of the radiator, in front of the fender well.</li> <li>Behind the right fender well, underneath the battery tray.</li> <li>Under the body tub, above, in front of, and parallel to the rear axle.</li> </ol> <p> Each spot is a different shape. The best choice depends on the shape of your tank and the amount of other stuff in your engine compartment. I chose to mount my tank by the rear axle. The maximum diameter of a tank in this position is 6\" if you want to avoid hitting it with your pinion yoke.</p> <p>When mounting your tank, it's important to have an outlet at the lowest point on the tank so you can drain moisture from it periodically. Regardless of what filters you have on the line, unless you live in a zero-humidity environment, water will condense on the inside of the tank when it depressurizes.  When I mounted my tank, I used a single hole on the bottom \"side\" of the tank for both input and output. I simply used a four-way cross connector that had the top connected to the bottom of the tank, the hose to the compressor coming out one side of the cross, a drain plug on the bottom of the cross, and a quick-disconnect fitting on the other side. The quick disconnect is a bit more difficult to reach than I'd originally envisioned, so I may drill a hole in my tub and move it inside the cab someday. To keep the inside of the quick disconnect clean, I capped off a male disconnect fitting and kept it plugged into the female end when not in use. I zip-tied the hose to the brake and fuel lines running along the inside of the frame rail and up into the engine compartment. The hose then ran along a lip on the bottom of the firewall just above the bell housing (I drilled a hole in this ledge and zip-tied the hose to it to ensure it wouldn't fall off and lie on anything hot. I coiled the extra foot or two of hose up under the battery tray, and then ran the end of it under the alternator to the front of the passenger fender well where the rest of the air fittings were located. This requires about 12' of hose; I picked up 15' of 1/4\" hose for $7 from the local surplus center.</p>"},{"location":"body/york/#the-compressor","title":"The Compressor","text":""},{"location":"body/york/#identification","title":"Identification","text":"<p>Most A/C compressors lubricate themselves with the freon that flows through the A/C system. To use these compressors for pumping air, you need to have an external oiler feeding oil into the intake hose and a filter to remove the oil from the output hose. Certain York-style compressors (the big, boxy, vertical kind) used an internal oil reservoir for lubrication, which makes them ideal for use as stand-alone air compressors. These compressors were commonly used on AMCs, Fords, and (I hear) Volvos in the '70's and early '80's.</p> <p>Therold Enterprises makes mounting brackets and alternator pulleys to mount an AMC York onto a current Jeep 4- or 6-cyl engine. The guy I talked to was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the differences in the various kinds of York compressors. He outlined three major differences in the various types: hose connectors, pulley clearance, and piston stroke length.</p> <p> Unless you have gobs of vertical hood clearance, you really want to get the AMC-style hose connectors, which run horizontally across the top of the compressor. The Ford-style connectors stick vertically out of the top of the compressors and then bend over to connect with the A/C hoses, which adds about 3\" to the total height of the unit. The good news is that these connectors are just screwed into the top of the compressor, and the two connector styles are interchangeable on the same compressor. The bad news is that the screw threads on the connectors are closer together than those on most 3/4\" pipe fittings, so it's nearly impossible to find connectors anywhere but on another York compressor. At left is a photo of my Ford-style compressor. The photo shows one Ford-style hose connector and one AMC-style connector so you can see the difference.</p> <p>Another difference between the AMC and Ford versions is the pulley. The AMC pulley is positioned very close (1/2\") to the body of the compressor. The Ford pulley sticks out about two inches away from the body. This might make a difference in your mounting bracket because the belt obviously needs to line up evenly with the pulley on the other end.</p> <p>The third difference is in the stroke length. There are reportedly three different stroke lengths, ranging from less than 7\" to over 10\". The longer the stroke, the more air the compressor can pump per minute. This doesn't vary by automaker, so there are two ways to tell which length you've got:</p> <ol> <li>If your compressor still has a metal York (not Motorcraft) ID tag bolted to the front of it, there will be a number on the tag that looks like \"F2 XXY \", where: XX | Stroke length ---|--- | 10 = long | 09 = medium | 07 = short Y | Discharge Direction | L = left | R = right</li> <li>Take off the clutch and look at the crankshaft.<ul> <li>Remove the center bolt (1/2\" socket)</li> <li>Remove the large washer</li> <li>Run a 5/8\" coarse thread bolt in until it forces the clutch off</li> <li>Look at the end of the crankshaft. The end is flat on all models.</li> <li>If the edge of the flat end is beveled, you've got the short stroke.</li> <li>If it's a sharp corner, but with a thin groove for a retaining clip, you've got the medium stroke.</li> <li>If it's a sharp corner without any groove, you've got the long stroke.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"body/york/#acquisition","title":"Acquisition","text":"<p>I've seen junkyard prices for old Yorks ranging from $12.50 to over $50. I had to pay $30 for my Ford model off a late-70's Fairmont, then shelled out another $20 to get AMC hose connectors and an idler pulley off an AMC Eagle at a different yard. If you can, have the yard personnel remove the compressor for you, since the placement of the mounting bolts makes removing it from the vehicle yourself a real PITA. When getting the hose connectors, try to grab a length of hose along with the weird connector. This will make it easier to connect it to your own custom setup later.</p> <p>Before you lay down your green, make sure the compressor works. To check whether it pumps air, plug the outlet hose with your thumb and then turn the inner portion of the clutch pulley several full revolutions. If, upon removing your thumb, you can feel the pressure difference, then it passed the test. Ideally, there should be no oil pumped out the hose, but a simple inline filter will fix that problem if it exists. The second test is whether the electric clutch works. The clutch is what locks the outer portion of the pulley where the belt runs to the inner portion of the pulley that's connected to the crankshaft. To check this, ground the compressor case on your vehicle. Then take the single wire that should be attached to the compressor and touch it to your positive battery terminal. You should hear a click as the clutch engages, and turning the outer portion of the pulley should then force the inner section to turn and pump air. When current is removed, the clutch should disengage, and the outer portion of the pulley should spin freely without moving the inner portion.</p>"},{"location":"body/york/#mounting","title":"Mounting","text":"<p>To hold oil, the compressor must be mounted vertically. The oil check/fill hole on my York is about halfway up the left (as you're facing the pulley) side of the compressor. Remove the bolt, then put a 90-degree bend in a section of metal coat hanger. Make sure it's long enough so that the end of the wire touches the bottom of the oil sump. I've seen oil level recommendations ranging from 1\" to halfway up the dipstick. The type of oil used isn't critical--regular old 10W-30 will work fine. A trigger-type oil squirter can seems to be the best way to add oil when necessary.</p> <p> Mounting the York to an old Jeep with a 258 ci inline-6 should be pretty easy, since this compressor was available from the factory. Just grab the OEM brackets from another 258 with A/C and you're good to go. Mounting it on any other engine requires fabrication of a custom mounting bracket. Complete mounting brackets for newer Jeep engines are available for $200+ from Therold Enterprises. If that's too steep for you, they'll sell you just the backplate for the compressor, with slots drilled for adjustable mounting bolts, for $12. If you're the do-it-yourself type, you could also fabricate your own design. Craig Myers has a good design for mounting to his '93 YJ 4-cyl that I believe is similar to what Therold sells. I ended up with (essentially) two 6x6x3/16\" steel plates welded together to form a T. A diagram with mounting hole measurements is on page 1. Measurements of the alternator bracket, compressor, and pulleys without the compressor bracket is on page 2.</p> <p>If your engine uses newer serpentine belts, you must somehow rig up a v-belt pulley to power the compressor's v-belt pulley. Therold sells a new alternator pulley for newer Jeeps that has both serpentine and v-belt grooves. This seems to be the route most people take, but their $40 price tag was a bit steep for me. I wandered around a junkyard until I found a pulley that would fit between my water pump pulley and the fan mount. I got one for $5 (I think it was from an '80-ish Chevy Caprice -- I forget exactly) that had 3 screw holes (my Jeep has four) and a 7/8\" center shaft hole (my Jeep's was 5/8\"). I took it to a local machinist who charged me $15 to narrow the center hole with a washer and drill a 4-hole bolt pattern to match that of my Jeep. I considered doing it myself, but a pulley spinning at 4K rpm will cause nasty vibrations and eventually tear up your water pump if it's not perfectly centered. My route was a bit more work, but I saved $20. The result required a 49.5\" v-belt. The center of the belt has at least an inch of play when I push hard, which is more than I'd like, but a 49\" belt just wasn't long enough. An idler pulley may be in order if belt slippage becomes a problem.</p> <p>The first picture below shows the pulley as it came off the donor vehicle. The second picture shows the modifications that the machinist made to allow mounting to my YJ. The third photo shows it mounted in place.  </p> <p>If I were doing it again, I might just buy the stuff from Therold rather than fabbing it myself. Their way uses a $40 pulley plus a $12 plate that allows the compressor to adjust itself vertically, guaranteeing a tight belt ($52 total). My set cost $20 for the re-machined pulley plus $40 for the bracket (got screwed there--he quoted me $25 initially). This cost $60 total, and I may have to add a sturdy, adjustable idler pulley to my compressor bracket if the belt turns out to be too loose.</p>"},{"location":"body/york/#air-fittings","title":"Air Fittings","text":"<p>I chose to mount the hose connectors and stuff on the inside of my front right wheel well near the factory jack. That location provides easy access and also keeps everything above the water line should I decide to ford any rivers.  </p> <p>The input hose on the York compressor needs to run to an air filter. I used a $4 crankcase filter (Fram part BA3631) that looked like it would match up well to my intake hose. A foot or so of electrical tape fastened it to the metal part of the intake hose connector.</p> <p>If your compressor leaks any oil out through the output hose, you'll want to install an inline air filter between the compressor and the rest of the system. This should trap any oil, water, or anything else that you don't want getting blown into your tank, tires, or tools. It doesn't look like my compressor has this problem, so I opted to save $20 and skip the filter.</p> <p>The output hose from the York (or the filter, if so equipped) needs to run to a check valve that prevents air from the rest of the system from flowing back into the compressor. If this were allowed to happen, the compressor would have to work much harder to start up initially.</p> <p>On the system side of the check valve, I installed a pressure switch. This switch turns the compressor's clutch on when the pressure in the system drops to a certain level, and turns it off again when the pressure climbs to a certain level. Many pressure switches have preset on and off levels, but I found one at a surplus center for $17 that has variable settings I can adjust myself. The difference between on and off is present to about 15-20 psi. I adjusted the turn on pressure to about 90-95 psi for now, putting the shut off pressure at just under 110 psi. If you're using this compressor to power your ARB air lockers, you must keep the pressure between 80 and 105 psi.</p> <p>Next to the pressure switch, I installed a 160 psi pressure gauge. Make sure you mount this such that it will be easily visible in less than optimal lighting without sticking your head down into a running engine. Mine ended up just rearward of the right headlight, lying sideways and facing straight up.</p> <p>Somewhere around here needs to be a pop-off safety valve rated the same as your wimpiest piece of hardware. In my case, the 125 psi tank was the limiting factor. If the pressure reaches a certain level, this valve will pop open to release the extra pressure before something more critical explodes.</p> <p>The last piece was a 1/4\" NPT quick-disconnect fitting to which I can attach the air hose of my choosing. I picked up a 25' long 1/4\" rubber air hose at the local surplus center for $7. (The spring-coiled hoses just don't stretch far enough to reach all four tires.)

The batteries handle only very shallow cycling, on the order of 1% in normal use. The starting battery will fail after approx. 100 cycles of 50%. Complete failure at 200 cycles. The sponge disintegrates with the repeated full charge and discharge chemical reactions. Lead particles separate from the plates and form micro-short circuits inside the battery. This highly increases the self-discharge rate. Maintenance-free batteries have added calcium to the lead sponges to harden them and reduce water loss. The calcium also increases the internal resistance, hence slowing self-discharge. The expected lifetime of a starting battery in true starting use is 3-5 years.

In RV use, with usually no more than 20% discharge, the battery should last 200-400 cycles. If cycled 80%, expect a lifetime of less than 200 cycles, or about the same as the starting battery.

There is almost no mechanical similarity between this battery and a starting battery. They are massive and huge. There are very few true deep cycle batteries with greater than 6 volts, as they would be too heavy to move by hand. The grids are over 4 times thicker than a starting battery's grids. And there is several times the amount of antimony in the grids. The plates are thick to add lifetime, not capacity. The plates are not constructed of sponge, but of scored sheets of lead with up to 16% antimony. The thickness of the plates combined with the high antimony content lowers the energy density, so this battery is heavier, larger and much more costly per kilowatt-hour. The case is also much thicker, and the plates usually leave a 1-3 inch space at the bottom to allow for accumulation of lead particles, so that they don't cause micro-shorts. The top of the case also has more space to allow for expansion of the electrolyte. Plates can be removed and serviced. As the cell interconnect straps are exposed, each cell's voltage can be measured individually. This allows the user to determine when an equalizing charge is necessary. Some batteries have \"wrapped\" plates, where perforated plastic is wrapped around the plates to keep the lead on them longer. Such a configuration add 25-35% to the lifetime of the battery. Such batteries are mostly used for electric vehicles, which force a fast 80% or more discharge. They are then recharge much more slowly. A 350 amp-hr 12 volt battery weighs 250 pounds and contains 4.5 gallons of sulphuric acid. They can be cycled 80% between 1000 and 2000 times.

Thus most liquid batteries cannot produce the same amount of energy at lower temperatures. If the electrolyte freezes then ionic mobility will be lowered to the point that the battery is basically useless. This will probably not happen too often because batteries have awful thermal conductivity so they never reach the ambient temperature unless of course you live in Alaska and leave it parked on a glacier the entire winter!! The other interesting thing about batteries is that at lower temperatures there is increased internal resistance. If you leave something small plugged in (like a radar detector) it will draw current. This current will flow through this internal resistor creating heat. This in turn will keep the battery warm. But it will drain some juice out of your battery.</p> <p>Heating a battery produces the opposite effect. The battery will yield more. The only problem is the electrons tend to go crazy and cause the battery to self destruct. I had the unpleasant experience of having a battery that was boiling BLOW UP in my house garage. Luckily the hood was up and I was behind my CJ. There was acid everywhere and my ears were ringing for about an hour. A boiling battery can produce a substantial amount of Hydrogen gas.

So much so that I'll bet most of you engineer to overkill. What are the issues you need to be concerned about?</p> <p>1. Use the smallest reasonable wire size for the required current.</p> <ul> <li>Wire is expensive and the larger you go, the more expensive it is.</li> <li>Wire is heavy and the larger you go, the heavier it gets.</li> <li>Mechanically, smaller wire is easier to route, easier to protect, easier to fit connectors on. Therefore it is more reliable mechanically - up to a pratical limit - see below.</li> </ul> <p>2. Use a large enough wire so there is no voltage drop. We want whatever it is we are wiring to operate at top efficiency.</p> <p>3. Maintain an adequate safety margin. We don't want to melt any wires.</p> <p>The first thing you have to do is determine the current you have to carry. For DC circuits, that's relatively easy. Some equipment on a car is rated directly in current draw. Auxiliary fans, fuel pumps and things like that are rated in current draw - Amps. Some equipment is rated in Watts - mostly the lighting equipment. The power requirement in Watts will be printed right on the bulb or stamped in the base. To come up with amps use one of the formulas shown.</p> <p>Let's calculate for a typical 100 Watt Driving Light - the power required is 100 Watts and the voltage is 12 Volts - so the current requirement is 100 Watts/12 Volts = 8.33 Amps. Let's assume you have to run a wire 6 feet from a relay to the lamp and look at the chart on the next page. Using the 10 Amp column you'll find that you can run 10 Amps on 15 feet of 18 AWG with only \u00bd Volt drop. Go to the next size larger for safety margin and you're at 16 AWG. Now in reality, you have to balance the mathematical results with mechanical reliability and efficiency. For lighting, the rated output is figured at 13.5 volts, not 12 volts. With the 0.5 volt drop shown in the chart, you have 13.0 volts available at the lamp - and at that 95% rated voltage, you are only going to get 80% of the rated output - or the equivalent of 80 watts from a 100 watt lamp. In our example, I'd go to 14 AWG as the wire and connectors are physically stronger, easier to work with, and there's no voltage drop - plus I only buy three sizes - 14, 12 and 10 AWG. Those three and crimp-on connectors are readily available just about anywhere. And except for primary circuits , those three sizes will cover just about anything you want to wire in a car with an adequate safety margin.</p> <p>Is your Alternator big enough for all your electrical equipment? Each 100 watt lamp is going to draw about 9 amps so six of them is going to suck up about 55 Amps. The other accessories on your car - cooling fan, heater fan, ignition, fuel pump, running lights, etc. - are going to draw roughly another 30-40 Amps - your total power requirement will reach about 90-100 Amps.</p> <p>It's impossible to compensate for a small alternator by throwing in a bigger battery as the battery will just be drained and the voltage will suffer, affecting your light output and overall performance. Your best solution is to go to a modern, high output alternator of at least 100 Amps or more. If you are really worried about weight, you're better off with a smaller battery. All it really has to do is start the engine if the alternator is large enough to carry the rest of the load after the car is running.</p>"},{"location":"electrical/#maximum-current-load-in-amps-12-volts-dc","title":"Maximum Current load in AMPS @ 12 Volts DC","text":"<p>Wire gauge in AWG vs wire length in feet</p> Gauge 1' 2' 4' 6' 8' 10' 20g 106 53 26 17 13 8 18g 150 75 37 25 18 15 16g 224 112 56 37 28 22 14g 362 181 90 60 45 36 12g 572 286 143 95 71 57 10g 908 454 227 151 113 90 8g 1452 726 363 241 181 145 6g 2342 1171 585 390 292 234 4g 3702 1851 925 616 462 370 2g 6060 3030 1515 1009 757 606 1g 7692 3846 1923 1280 961 769 0g 9708 4854 2427 1616 1213 970"},{"location":"electrical/#maximum-current-load-in-amps-12-volts-dc_1","title":"Maximum Current load in AMPS @ 12 Volts DC","text":"<p>Wire gauge vs. maximum current by length (feet)</p> 12' 15' 20' 50' 100' 200' 20g 18g 12 16g 18 14 14g 30 24 18 12g 47 38 28 10g 75 60 45 8g 120 96 72 29 6g 194 155 117 46 23 4g 307 246 185 74 37 2g 503 403 303 121 60 30 1g 638 511 384 153 76 38 0g 805 645 485 194 97 48 <p>Calculate the current load and find the next highest on the top row.

Other than that, the two versions are the same although it seems the stepper motor version is a bit more troublesome.</p>"},{"location":"engine/general/carter/#the-symptoms","title":"The Symptoms","text":"<p>The symptoms of the problem include stumbling and sputtering at idle. In advanced cases, the Jeep will stall at every stop sign and will only run at high RPMs. Gas mileage will suffer since fuel will just be sloshing out at idle. Sometimes the idle will be turned up to a high RPM to avoid the problem. Typically, the Jeep will run fine at higher RPMs (unless there are also other problems.)</p> <p>For a sure diagnosis, park the Jeep with the engine off and remove the air cleaner cover. There should be a plate over the throat of the carb, the choke plate. If you open the choke plate you should be able to see down the throat of the carb and you should see two screws with holes in the middle of them. Next to them are two passages with a nozzle in the middle of each. This thing is known as the venturi, when air passes by, fuel is supposed to be drawn out through the nozzles. If the idle tubes are clogged fuel will drip from those nozzles during idle.</p> <p>In order to see if fuel drips from the nozzles at idle, you must start your Jeep with the air cleaner cover off and look down the throat of the carb. The Jeep Technical Service Manual recommends that, when you do this, you cover the air cleaner with a piece of plexiglass since the engine can backfire through the carb and a flame can shoot out. Since I am reckless and like living dangerously, I never do this.</p> <p>After you have chosen the wise or foolish path, start your Jeep and open the choke plate. If your idle tubes are badly clogged, you will see fuel dripping from the nozzles at idle (if your Jeep will idle at all.) If you don't see fuel dripping, but your idle is still poor, open the throttle a bit with your hand or have a friend hit the accelerator. You should see two even streams of fuel and no dripping from the nozzles. Any dripping means clogged idle tubes.</p> <p>While you are doing this, make sure you don't put your hand or anything else into rotating parts like the fan. Keep your tie away from that thing (some people just want to look good all the time.) Same goes if you are a \"long hair, freaky\" Tesla type. All joking aside, I've heard some bad stories.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"engine/general/carter/#the-solution","title":"The Solution","text":"<p>Neither removal of the carburetor nor a complete rebuild is necessary to fix the problem. To fix the problem, start with you Jeep off and parked securely:</p> <ol> <li>Remove the air cleaner cover and air cleaner. You may need to remove a few hoses and wires to get the air cleaner out of the way. Make sure you tag them all so you can put them back in the right spot. It's often easiest not to remove the heater hose that goes to the exhaust manifold, if you have one.</li> <li>Remove hoop that holds air cleaner.</li> <li>Remove the two screws holding the choke plate with a 3/16\" socket or small flat blade screw driver depending on what screws you have holding it. Be careful not to drop the screws down the manifold unless you enjoy fishing. Remove the choke plate.</li> <li>If your carb has one, remove the plate on the side that covers the choke linkage so you can access the screw holding the choke rod. It may be necessary to drill out a rivet to get it free.</li> <li>Remove the little snap ring and screw (1/4\" socket) that holds the rod that holds the choke plate and remove the rod. A screw driver will normally push off the snap ring.</li> <li>Remove the two screws with holes in the middle of them and carefully remove the venturi cluster with the two little gaskets. There should be two idle pickup tubes pushed into the venturi sticking out of the bottom. If they have fallen out, that could cause your idle problem.</li> <li>Blast the venturi and inside of carb with lots of carb cleaner. Be sure not to dislodge the check ball in the center.</li> <li>With a long thin pin or piece of piano wire, make sure the idle tubes and nozzles are clear. After you have run them through, spray with more carb cleaner.</li> <li>Put the cleaned out venturi cluster back with the two gaskets and two screws.</li> <li>Replace the choke rod with snap ring and screw and replace the choke plate. Make sure all the screws are tight that hold together the carb body at this time. Often the screws will loosen up and dirt will be sucked into the carb.</li> <li>Replace the plate covering the choke linkage with a sheet metal screw, or leave it off.</li> <li>Replace the air cleaner.</li> </ol> <p>Smooth idle should have returned after this simple process. If you still have idle problems and don't have any dripping, make sure all the vacuum hoses are hooked up and in good shape. Also check for leaks around the intake manifold or a loose carburetor.</p> <p>To avoid repeated clogged idle tubes, drill out the idle tubes to 0.032\". This will greatly reduce the frequency of clogging and it is a procedure that was actually recommended by Jeep for a while.</p> <p>An alternative to removing the choke plate and all is to just remove the top of the carburetor. The advantage of this approach is you can make sure there isn't a lot of junk in the bowls, you can check your float adjustment, etc. It also may help if you have power brakes because the master cylinder may be in the way of getting the choke rod out.</p>"},{"location":"engine/upgrades/convbuickv6/","title":"Swapping a Buick V6 Into Your Jeep","text":"<p> by Terry Howe</p> <p>Consider the Buick V6, it is short, plentiful, and powerful.

Kaiser purchased the tooling to build the engine from Buick in 1967 and began production of the engine. The \"Dauntless\" 225 is an \"odd fire\" engine meaning the cylinders fire odd order. The odd-fire design cause a the engine to idle a bit rough. This version of the engine and parts from these Jeeps can be used to swap a Buick V6 into your Jeep.</p> <p>One big advantage of the Dauntless 225 V6 is the heavy flywheels used on these engines. The flywheels come in 75lbs and 100lbs versions to create low end torque. The normal car flywheels are closer to 45lbs.</p>"},{"location":"engine/upgrades/convbuickv6/#buick-231","title":"Buick 231","text":"<p>When AMC purchased Jeep, they started putting AMC engines in Jeeps. The Buick V6 was not used after 1971 and with the gas crisis, Buick became interested in the V6 engine again. They purchased the tooling back from Jeep in 1974 and reworked the engine so it use components from the Buick 350 engine. The larger bore increased the displacement to 231 cubic inches.</p> <p>In mid 1977, Buick introduced the first \"even fire\" version of the Buick V6. This engine has a smoother idle, but more vibration than the older engine. The odd fire engine uses a distributor cap with equal spaces between the plugs on the distributor cap and the even fire engine has unequal spaces between the plugs on the distributor cap. It is not very intuitive, but that's the way it is.</p> <p>The 231s are internally balanced and the 225s are externally balanced. Technically, you need to rebalance a 231 if you replace the flywheel or install a flywheel in place of a flex plate. Some people report that they have had no problem swapping different flywheels on these later engines with out rebalancing.</p> <p>Later Buick 231s use multiport fuel injection. The Buick V6s never used TBI fuel injection from the factory.</p>"},{"location":"engine/upgrades/convbuickv6/#swap-stories","title":"Swap Stories","text":"<p> Project Pieces &amp; Parts Engine Installation : Project Pieces &amp; Parts finally gets the fired up with a Buick 231 V6 sitting on engine mounts from Advanced Adapters.</p>"},{"location":"engine/upgrades/convbuickv6/#bibliography","title":"Bibliography","text":"<p>Some of the information in this article was obtained from Ken Mosher's Buick V6 History article.</p>"},{"location":"history/","title":"Willys Overland Production Figures","text":"<p>You won't find more accurate Willys-Overland production information anywhere else. This production information was transcribed into electronic form by Charlie Weaver from a hand written a compilation Norton Young did between 1959 and 1961. Norton Young was an employee of Willys/Kaiser at the time and did the compilations so that executives at Kaiser would have yearly production information.</p> <p>There are disparities between this production information and production information from other sources. Many things could cause these disparities, but the most likely thing to cause them would be the choice of start and end times. In the early years Willys-Overland did not have model years like automobile manufactures do today. In fact, it was common for mid year changes to be made when ever the engineering department came up with new ideas. Norton Young's production numbers are based on build date and a regular calendar year.</p> <p>Titling practices in the 40s and 50s were very relaxed by today's standards. Many states in the US didn't title cars at all and a sales receipt was enough for proof of ownership. Often, vehicles were titled the year they were sold or the dealerships would send away to the manufactures for \"fresh\" paper work so last years models could be sold as current year models. If you have an older Jeep, chances are the title is wrong.</p> <p>It is common to look up a serial number for a Jeep to determine the year the vehicle was built, because it is common to have an incorrect title or no title at all for an old vehicle. To make this process easier, the serial numbers have been organized by model. The original data compiled by Mr. Young was organized by year.</p> <p>It is a shame that Norton Young didn't continue to keep production statistics. Charlie contacted Mr Young to talk about his work:</p> <p>In a talk with Norton Young a week or 2 ago, he told me that by 1961, the folks in the corner offices at K-F had no more interest in these statistics so he quit keeping them. He also said that he had difficulty getting \"timely\" reports from the production people, and often had to go through the unit sheets himself and try to piece the info together. He admitted that there may be some errors.</p> <p>This article is not meant to cover passenger cars, but the information was available in the original, so it has been included rather than edited out.</p> <p>The following abbreviation key explains some of the known abbreviations used in the original.

I am now legally\nblind. :-).\nIn a talk with Norton Young a week or 2 ago, he told me\nthat by 1961, the folks in the corner offices at K-F\nhad no more interest in these statistics so he quit\nkeeping them. He also said that he had difficulty\ngetting \"timely\" reports from the production people,\nand often had to go thru the unit sheets himself and\ntry to piece the info together. He admitted that there\nmay be some errors.\nList #12 is the worst one for errors, there being 6412\nmore units produced, according to the serial numbers,\nthan show on the original sheets. For this one sheet\nI show the corrected numbers. For instance, 6-226 4WD\n55268, shows only 255 units produced, but serial\nnumbers indicate 7747 units. Based on 1960 figures,\n7747 seems to be correct. Also, 475 2x4 Mav. 58147\nshows only 202 units on original, understated by\n1000.\nTodd, I give up. What is an El Goucho??\nI also don't know what a \"CPC\" is, or an \"AVA\".\nIf anyone runs across an inconsistency - and if you\ndon't it will be a miracle - please post it to the\nlist so we can check it out.\n\n***\nCharlie \"SleeveValve\" Weaver, Winston-Salem, NC\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"models/cj-2a/","title":"CJ-2A","text":"<p>The CJ-2A was the first civilian Jeep.

The CJ-7 is basically a stretched CJ-5. An extra 10\" was added behind the front seats to make the CJ-7 a 91\" wheelbase vehicle vs. the CJ-5s 81\". The extra 10\" allowed AMC to offer an automatic transmission for the first time in a CJ. A CJ-7 tub can be identified by the shape of the door opening, the opening is square, where as the CJ-5 has a curving door opening. The Wrangler (YJ) tub has the same dimensions as the CJ-7 and can be used on a CJ-7 with some modifications.</p> <p>The CJ-7 also was available with a hard top and doors from the factory. Hard tops and doors were available for earlier models, but not from the factory.</p> <p>A new fully boxed frame was available for CJs from '76-'86 and although the welds are ugly, the frame is stronger than frames used in previous CJs. The frame was widened in the rear and the springs were moved farther out to make the CJs more stable on the road, unfortunately this mildly reduces the articulation of the rear axle. Other features such as sway bars and steering stabilizers were added around this time to increase handling. Another change in 1982 was made to make the CJs more stable, wider axles were used. There are some differences in shock mounting, but \"wide track\" axles are compatible with '76-'81 \"narrow track\" CJs and visa-versa.</p> <p>1980 marked the end of the Great Transmission Era.

Factory replacement parts are still available, but they tend to wear out quickly when used with large tires in off-road conditions. The boot on the factory bell coupler at the lower end of the factory shaft tends to wear out and allow grit into the bell coupler assembly, causing wear to accelerate. The factory upper U-joint is not sealed and does not incorporate any type of bearing.</p> <p>There is a better answer than replacing your worn steering shaft with OEM replacement parts. Borgeson makes replacement steering shafts for CJs and many other types of vehicles that incorporate much stronger sealed needle bearing type U-joints. Because the U-joints are of the needle bearing design and are sealed, they will last much longer under hard conditions.

The only real disadvantage of going SOA is the possibility of inducing wheel hop, but as I will explain later wheel hop is easily controlled. SOA has been used by many manufactures on both front and rear ends, and these OEM SOA setups prove that it works well.</p> <p>You can get your CJ to ramp 1000+ by using Wrangler YJ springs. YJ springs can often be found for free from a friend who has installed lift springs or purchased cheaply used from a 4wd shop. Wrangler springs work well for CJ spring over axle (SOA) conversions because their length and their arc. The YJ springs are slightly longer than CJ springs and a longer spring has more droop than a shorter spring. The stock YJ springs are almost flat under load which makes them good for a spring over because they do not provide any more lift. A spring over alone normally provides more than sufficient lift. Another advantage of the flat springs is flat springs articulate better than arced springs during compression.</p> <p>With flat arch front springs such as YJ springs an expensive shackle reversal becomes unnecessary and even counter productive. With flat arch front springs that are anchored at the rear the tire will move towards the rear on either compression or extension. The reason is the flat arch places the tire at it's farthest forward point when the suspension is at rest, and when the spring arches either positively or negatively the arch will cause the tire to be moved slightly rearwards.</p> <p>With the flat arch springs on a SOA you can also angle your front shackles further forwards than most people normally would. The reason you can do this is similar to the reason a shackle reversal becomes unnecessary, the shackle end spring eye will move towards the rear on either compression or extension. This has 2 benefits. First it gives the shackles more room to move rearwards and frees up more droop. Secondly having the shackles raked forwards makes it less likely that you will pop one over center to the rear and bend a spring.</p>"},{"location":"suspension/cjsoa/#springs","title":"Springs","text":"<p>The rear springs used in CJs and YJs are the same width, so the rear springs bolt right in. The YJ front springs are a little longer and wider than CJ front springs. The fixed spring hanger for the CJs front spring is the correct width because the CJ front spring uses a wide bushing in the back. It is the shackle side of the CJ that is not compatible with the YJ front springs.</p> <p> For the shackle end of the front springs, CJ rear spring hangers are the right width and only cost about $14.99ea new. They need to be moved forward so that the rear hole in the spring hanger goes where the old front hole used to be. There is a rivet in the frame at the location where the new front hole needs to be. The rivet holds the cross member in place. I welded the cross member to the frame, ground the heads off the rivets and punched them out. The bolt holes lined up perfectly. The picture to the left shows where the front spring hanger needs to be modified. The red arrow points to the rivet to be removed and the blue area shows where to weld. Weld before removing the rivet so everything stays in place. The rivet hole will be used for the forward bolt on the spring hanger.</p> <p> Moving the hanger forward leaves a space between the steering box bracket and frame where the back part of the spring hanger used to be.

Another solution is fabricate a bracket to move the drag link over the spring.</p> <p>For my personal project I converted to spring over steering. Because of the serious nature of steering work I'm going to say \"If you have to ask how you shouldn't try to build it yourself.\" Although I designed the arms myself I enlisted the help of a fellow 4 wheeler who is also an expert machinist to do the actual work. Many of the companies that make custom width front ends are selling similar spring over steering kits. The kits consist of steering knuckles from a '74-76 FSJ or Chevy and some custom steering arms that bolt to the flat area on top of the knuckle. These kits put the tie rod about as high as the top of the diff cover, which works out perfectly for SOA with YJ springs.</p> <p>By custom designing my steering arms I was able to retain the use of stock wide track CJ linkages even though my Dana 44 front is 2\" wider than my Dana 30 was.

Some sort of anti-spring wrap measures must be taken.</p> <p> I used a ladder bar with a shackle and threaded section on the leading side and a fixed mount to the axle tube on the trailing side. It controls axle wrap and wheel hop completely while still allowing full articulation. My ladder bar does this by controlling the pinion angle while still allowing every other type of movement including twisting. If the pinion angle can't change the springs will not wind up and wheel hop is prevented. I bent my ladder bar and broken the axle tube mount by testing on pavement and rocks, but even in this half functional state it still worked fine. I've been driving with this setup for a whole season already and so far I've experienced no wheel hop.</p> <p>I fabricated the axle end mount for the ladder bar to put the bottom bar only an inch or so below the axle tube and the top bar about 8 inches above. The front end of the bar mounts to a frame cross member I built, but many people mount them to their skid plate.

Well they did, the military version of the CJ-5, the M38A1 always had the shackle to the rear.

Obviously, springs do not shrink and grow, but the distance between the eyes changes when they flex. Flat springs are at their maximum length at rest and any flex decreases the distance between the eyes.</p> <p> With flat arch springs on a CJ or YJ with the conventional setup the tire already goes backwards as it goes up, in fact it also goes backwards as it goes down. This is because the spring is it's longest when it is flat and curving it either way shortens the spring and draws the tire towards the fixed end. This can be demonstrated on any stock YJ by noting the angle of the shackle relative to the frame when it is sitting on flat ground, and then again when one tire has been run up a ramp. On the ramp the bottom end of both front shackles will be more towards the rear than when on flat ground because one spring will be arched positively and one negatively.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"suspension/elkcahs/#axle-movement-with-arched-springs","title":"Axle Movement With Arched Springs","text":"<p>With heavily arched springs such as used in normal 4\" spring under axle lift kits and the conventional fixed spring hanger at the rear the front tire will come forwards when it rises to go over a bump.

The reason is similar to the reason for the improved highway ride. When the brakes are applied the tire is effectively pulled hard to the rear of the Jeep by the braking force.

The compression from the tire pulling back combined with the forwards weight transfer that normally happens during braking cause the nose of the Jeep to drop more than a non shackle reversed jeep.</p> <p>With arched springs and no shackle reversal the force of the tire being pulled towards the rear of the Jeep causes the spring to arch more.

The tools to build it can be found in most garages and the parts won't cost an arm and a leg. The following parts are necessary for the project:</p> <ul> <li>2 - Stock Rear CJ Spring Packs (post-'76) or stock YJ Spring Packs (front or rear)</li> <li>2 - Stock Rear CJ or YJ U-bolt plates</li> <li>4 - Custom bent U-bolts with washers and nuts</li> </ul> <p> The first thing to do to make your 3/4 elliptical spring pack is to remove centering pin from CJ spring packs. Next, remove spring clamps that hold the pack together. They may pop apart when the clamps are released. Pull out the main leaves and cut them 5-1/2\" from the centering pin towards the small bushing. A hand grinder, or circular saw with metal cutting blade, will make this cut.</p> <p> After the main leaf is cut to length, drill a new 3/8\" hole 3\" in from the cut end. Re-install the centering pin in new hole. After a quick coat of paint, the quarter leaves should be ready for installation.</p> <p> Raise the rear of the vehicle so the rear tires are just touching the ground and support with jack stands. Working one side at a time, remove the rear shackle from the frame and spring. Place the quarter leaf spring under frame so bushing and original shackle mount are lined up front to rear. Mark the location of the centering pin on frame and set the quarter leaf aside. Drill a 1/2\" hole on bottom of frame for the centering pin. Use a spare 1/2\" bolt to line up the U-bolt plate and use the U-bolts to mark the location for holes through the cross member welded inside the frame rail. Drill two 9/16\" holes per side in the cross member for u-bolts. Craig had to remove the exhaust to drill the holes through the cross member on the passenger side. Install the U-bolts over frame and through the 9/16\" holes.</p> <p> Place the quarter leaf spring onto the bottom of the frame and put the centering pin into 1/2\" hole. Secure the quarter leaf spring with the U-bolt plates and tighten the U-bolts to 90 ft/lbs. Re-install the shackles to the quarter leaf spring bushing and the original spring bushing.</p> <p>Craig reports that it took him about 3 hours to do the 3/4 elliptical conversion. On his YJ, he got about 1-1/4\" of lift from the conversion, similar to the amount of lift you would get from a shackle lift. Since this lift will turn the pinion upwards, you may be able to remove any shims that were installed for a lift kit. On a CJ, the lift would be next to nothing since the top of the shackle on a CJ mounts on the bottom of the frame.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"suspension/ubolt/","title":"Flip Your U-Bolts","text":"<p>Are you tired yet of dragging, bending, and breaking your axle u-bolts on rocks? Well flip your u-bolts to gain ground clearance and protect them from damage. I was able to do the u-bolt inversion for around $50 and it only took me a couple of hours.</p> <p> The first thing that is needed to perform a u-bolt inversion are u-bolt plates from an 80s 1/2 ton Dodge pickup or Dodge Ramcharger. There are probably other sources for plates like these, but these plates are pretty easy to find. I purchased some u-bolt plates from an auto recycler for less than $20. You should be able to pick them up for next to nothing since they are not exactly an item that normally generates any revenue for an auto recycler.</p> <p>The 80s Dodge Ramcharger and 1/2 ton pickup use a Dana 44 rear end, so the plates will work for for any Jeep with a Dana 44 or AMC 20 rear end. The CJ AMC 20 uses a slightly smaller tube, so you might want to grind the plates a bit to get a better fit. The Dodge trucks are spring over in the rear and the plates are curved to fit a Dana 44 with square u-bolts attaching the axle to the spring.</p> <p>The Dodge plates have a shock mounted integrated into the plate. Since the plates are run upsidedown from the way they are run on the Dodge, the shock mount is really to high to be useful. I cut them off with a circular hand saw with a metal cutting blade.</p> <p> After you have aquired some u-bolt plates, you need to get some u-bolts. I went to my local spring shop (Rocky Mountain Spring in the Springs) and had custom square u-bolts made 4\" long and 2.5\" wide. The cost was only $26 for these u-bolts.</p> <p> The last item needed is some way to attach the shock to the axle. On CJs, the shock bolts to the u-bolt plate. What I did to resolve this problem was purchase some Con-Fer shock mounts for $5 and weld them to the axle tube. You could fabricate your own shock mounts and weld them on, but for the the price, it wasn't worth it to me. If you don't have access to a welder, it would probably only take a professional welder a few minutes to attach the shock mounts for you.</p> <p>If the idea of welding shock mounts does not appeal to you, there is one other option that Chris Kutish came up with. Chris took a small piece of 3/4\" steel and machined out grooves in it for the square u-bolts. Then he drilled it and tapped it for a replaceable shock mount stud. He also machined down the leading and trailing edges so it would slide over rocks easier. One advantage of this approach is the force of the u-bolts is spread out over the springs. This approach also keeps the shock a bit lower than the weld on brackets which may provide more articulation. A disadvantage of this approach is you lose about a quarter inch of ground clearance and it is much more time consuming to fabricate the plates than weld on the mount.</p> <p>After the shock mount was welded on and painted, I put the Jeep on jack stands, removed the old u-bolts, put the plate on top of the axle tube, and bolted on the square u-bolts with the nuts on the top.</p> <p>I first saw this u-bolt inversion done on a CJ-7 owned by Rick Borios.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"suspension/yjsh/","title":"Wrangler YJ Travel Trick","text":"<p>Before After</p> <p>I was helping Eric Resko install a Dana 44 rear end in his '87 Wrangler when he showed me a neat trick to increase travel of the rear axle.

Increasing tires size can greatly increase the off-road capabilities of your vehicle. Larger tires provide increases in total ground clearance, an increased traction footprint &amp; flotation, make climbing obstacles easier, can be easier on the environment and just plain look better on your Jeep. However all of these benefits have a price.</p> <p>Larger tires are more expensive in general and may require expensive suspension upgrades for proper clearance, especially on the trail.</p> <p>Tires more than an inch or two larger than stock may require you to change the ring &amp; pinion gears in the differentials of both the front and rear axle in order to keep your engine running in the optimum power range - especially when off-road, going uphill or driving on the freeway.</p> <p>Increased tire diameter increases the torque loads on the axles, u-joints &amp; drive shafts. For significantly larger tires it is usually necessary to upgrade these components, especially where traction aiding devices such as lockers or limited slip is used, or you may risk breaking one of these components on the trail.</p> <p>Bigger tires are heavier tires. This increased rotating mass and the increased leverage provided by the larger tire often call for increases in braking power: changing brake pad materials, rear disc brake conversions, beefing up the master cylinder or even switching to larger disk and calipers are all options. Driving a tall, heavy, modified short wheelbase Jeep with 35\" tires and stock brakes in poor condition at highway speeds can be a recipe for disaster!</p> <p>Increases weight caused by the larger tire and any axle or brake upgrades also increases unsprung weight. This does not matter much on the trail, but can make the ride a higher speeds much more harsh. When mounting the tire you will find that it is often much more difficult to balance the tire correctly. This is due to the extra weight of the tire, the increased rotating inertia of the tire and manufacturers tolerances on larger tires. It can take quite a bit of weight to balance a large tire and many shops that do not routinely handle tires of this size may not do a good job.</p> <p>So - bigger tires have a price, the bigger the size change the more modifications are needed to properly set up your Jeep; still, on the trail, there are times when putting more rubber on the ground, or more space between the vehicle and the ground, is exactly what you need.</p> <p>On my 1990 Jeep YJ I decided to switch from 31\" tires to 35\" tires while not wanting to risk breakage on the trial. The total price of those 4 35\" tires was probably close to $7,000 dollars!. This included a 4\" suspension lift, a 2\" body lift, fender trimming, changing to heavy duty, custom modified, 1 ton truck axles, changing to 4.10 gears in both differentials (+ lockers and carrier changes), and adding rear disk brakes. In addition the lift and axles necessitated transfer case modifications and custom drive shafts in both ends. It was not a simple, cheap or fast project - but on the trail it sure is sweet!</p>"},{"location":"tire/#trade-offs-tire-size-width","title":"Trade-Offs Tire Size (width)","text":"<p>Tire diameter is not the only issue - tire width is important to. Wider tires increase footprint which can be important for traction or increased flotation. The tradeoff include that wider tires can also require extended fender coverage in many states and may require changes in wheel width &amp; offset to work properly. On stock offset wheels the tires may be mostly covered by the stock fender flares but rub on suspension components when turning thus reducing effective turning radius. The incredibly tight turning radius of a jeep is one of it's important advantages on the trail. Wider wheels or wheels with increased offset move the tires outboard and can greatly reduce the rubbing when turning but make the vehicle wider. This increased width may be an advantage for stability if you drive a lifted vehicle or a disadvantage of you are squeezing down a trail better suited for a Samurai or a quad. Lastly narrower tires can sometimes be an advantage where the best traction is located just a few inches below the surface (such a shallow snow or mud) and the decreased footprint and increased pressure aids the tires in getting down to where it can get a bite.</p>"},{"location":"tire/#tread-patterns","title":"Tread Patterns","text":"<p>The choice of tread pattern is important in your new tire decision making process. Tread pattern should be chosen based on the intended use of the Jeep. The most popular tread pattern for all around off-road use is a mud terrain pattern.</p> <p>The mud terrain or mud tire pattern is characterized by large lugs on the tire with large voids between these lugs. The large lugs provide plenty of bite in low traction conditions while the large voids allow the tire to clean itself by throwing off mud or other material when spinning thus providing a good bite on every rotation of the tire. These tires are also very popular for rock crawling as the large lugs can provide a way of gripping and pulling the tires up and over irregular rocky edges where a smoother pattern would just spin. The biggest disadvantage of these patterns is that they run rough and loud on the highway. To reduce this problem choose a tire with irregular or asymmetric spacing of the lugs and voids to reduce harmonic vibration at highway speeds. There are also situations such cold powder snow or sand where an all-terrain pattern would be better.</p> <p>The general purpose all terrain tire generally has an interlocked tread pattern with siping (small cuts) on the tread blocks. The voids in these tires are also generally much smaller than those on tires designed for use in the mud. The denser pattern of blocks and smaller voids make these tires quieter on the street. It also increases the surface area of the tread which gives the tire improved flotation on surfaces such as light powdery snow or sand. The increased siping can be important in snow were it is the number of edges, even quite small edges, biting into the snow that provides the \"bite\". The downside is that the smaller voids cannot clean themselves as easily of packed mud or slush as the larger voids on mud tires do. If these voids fill up with mud the tire loses much of it's \"bite\" and traction is lost.</p> <p>While the all terrain pattern's improved flotation and additional siping may be an advantage in absolutely dry powder or packed snow, the mud terrain may be the wiser choice if the snow or underlying terrain is, or can turn, slushy or muddy. In these cases the all terrain pattern can become packed with mud and stuck where a mud terrain pattern would self clean and plow on through.</p> <p>In sand the improved flotation provided by the dense tread pattern of the all-terrain tires can be a distinct advantage.</p> <p>A variety of manufacturers also offer a family of tires sometimes called trail tires or something near that. These are most often tires designed for use on light trucks or sport utility vehicles which see most of their use on the street. They will generally be quieter, get better gas mileage and last longer than either of the other off-road patterns. The tread patterns are designed to provide significantly improved comfort or performance on the street which can sometimes compromise serious off-road capability. I personally would not recommend them for anything other than light off-road use in dirt, on unpaved roads or trails where you are unlikely to encounter mud, significant rocks or other unpleasant conditions. Fortunately this is the limit to which most of their intended market are likely to take them.</p>"},{"location":"tire/fit33/","title":"Big Tire, Little Lift","text":"<p>The best set up for your Jeep is to use the least amount of lift possible to fit your target tire size.

Steeper drive shaft angles can cause vibration problems and decrease u-joint life. Often, shims are used under the spring perches and transfer case lowering kits are added to resolve drive line vibration problems. The shims have a tendency to break and fall out. Large shims will starve the pinion bearing of gear lube and decrease its life. Sometimes the spring king pin will have to be replaced with a longer one when large shims are used. If the large king pin is not used, the axle housing may shift if the king pin does not have a firm hold in the spring perch.

My narrow track Dana 30 would allow the front tires to tuck right in, but the wider axle causes the front tires to rub the outside edge of the front fender.

The T-98 has a 1 1/16\" 10 spline input shaft and 1 3/8\" 6 spline output.</p> <p> T-18s used after 1978 have reverse down by fourth and earlier T-18s have reverse up by third. The shape of the case is also different with the '79+ cases for the different reverse configuration. On the right is a T-18 out of a '79 CJ-5. The blue T-18 in the picture above is out of a '78 CJ-5. Notice the later T-18 has a flat side rather than the bulging side of the earlier T-18. Both versions have a PTO port on the drivers side.</p> <p>The T-18s used in full size Jeeps(FSJs) such as the Chorokee, Wagoneer, and J-series pickups use a transmission to bell housing adapter. Three basic variations exist with different adapters.</p> <ul> <li>Early 70s T-18s use a 1\" cast iron adapter with a deep AMC bell housing. The bell housing is the same as the bell housing used with the T-15.</li> <li>Later 70s FSJs with V8 engines use a 5\" aluminum adapter and a AMC T-15 bell housing. There are pictures of this version below.</li> <li>Later 70s FSJs with I6 engines use a shoter aluminum adapter and a AMC T-15 bell housing.</li> </ul> <p>The different adapter means a different length input shaft is used. The input shaft size and spline count is consistent for all the Jeep T-18s, but the pilot bushing size varies. The different adapters used with the later V8 and I6 engine where presumably used to keep the drive shaft lengths consistent regardless of engine.</p> <p>All Jeep T-18s come with a 1\" adapter for the Dana 20 transfer case except the T-18 used in 1980 and 1981 J-20 pickups. These trucks used the NP208 transfer case and the adapter for the NP208 is around 9\" long and it uses a round bolt pattern. The output shaft of this version of the T-18 is 23 spline. The Dana 20 version of the T-18 has the big hole \"Texas\" bolt pattern and 6 spline output shaft.</p> <p> A picture of a wide ratio T-18 from a J-10 pickup with the 360 V8.

The TF 727 was used in full size Jeeps (SJs and J series pickups) in the 80s and early 90s. It has the standard AMC bolt pattern on the engine side and it has the circular bolt pattern and 23 spline output on the transfer case side. The transfer case bolt pattern for the 727 is the same as Dana 300, and most of the New Process transfer cases used in 1980+ Jeeps.</p> <p> Rick Boiros was kind enough to see how a Dana 300 and TF 727 fit together on his garage floor and take some pictures. The tricky part of this combination is the 727 comes from the factory with a New Process transfer cases which are drivers drop and the Dana 300 is passenger drop. The bolt pattern is the same, but the clocking of the transfer case is different. According to Rick the clocking of the Dana 300 on the 727 is pretty much set since there isn't enough material on the adapter to drill it for an alternate clocking.</p> <p> On a CJ, there is not sufficient clearance for the drive shaft with a stock suspension, but with a three to four inch lift and a dropped bump stop, the drive shaft will not hit the pan. The picture to the right shows the Dana 300 and 727 combination with a 6-8 degree angle on the drive shaft. This angle on the drive shaft gives keeps it clear of the pan.</p> <p>Some people have reported using stock drive shafts with the TF727 swap. Mark Timon says with his 360 and TF727 swap, his rear drive shaft is 20.75\" and his front drive shaft is 32.75\". These are respectable lengths for a CJ-7 with an automatic.</p> <p>A TF727 swap with a New Process transfer case is less of an issue since all New Process transfer cases used in Jeeps are drivers drop, so the clocking would be the same. Some TF727s are used with the NP208 which is a heavy duty transfer case that has a regular yoke output. If the 727 was going to be swapped into a YJ, it might be worth using the NP208 from the donor, since it does not have the slip yoke.</p> <p>Probably the hardest part of doing a TF727 swap is getting the correct kick down linkage. Most full size Jeeps used the AMC 360 during the 80s and early 90s and most CJs and YJs used the AMC 258. The linkage is different and the proper linkage and proper adjustment of the linkage is essential to transmission life. If an engine swap is also planned to a 360 or 401, this will not be an issue.</p> <p>A solution to the kickdown problem is swap in a kickdown cable for the TF727 which is available from Lokar Performance. Racing and hot rod suppliers list this cable in their catalogs. Tom Anhalt reports using it successfully in his '81 full size Cherokee with 258/TF727/NP208 combination.

This results in a small amount of oil leaking out and while usually not causing any problem, it smells, and could find it's way onto the clutch, causing slipping problems.</p> <p>Some SM420's have a tubular shifter and some have a forged shifter, the forged shifter is easier to bend, it can be heated with a torch and pulled into the position you want, whereas the tubular lever tends to collapse when bending. The shifter will have to be bent to give your hand clearance at the dash when shifting to first and third.</p> <p>Very late SM420s have a reverse light switch.</p>"},{"location":"transmission/upgrades/sm420yj/#bell-housing-and-clutch","title":"Bell Housing and Clutch","text":"<p>The bell housing used for this swap is the bell housing from an 1986 Chevy S-10 with a 2.8 V6 and a five speed.

In some cases a different transmission can be the best upgrade to your Jeep as far as performance and reliability. What transmission you select to put in your Jeep depends on what you find and what you have. We'll assume you are keeping your engine and transfer case and that you already have a manual transmission. Also, keep in mind these are my opinions of what will be the cheapest and easiest swap for most people. I haven't done most of these swaps either, a lot of my information came from people on-line and from books (YMMV).</p> <p>Generally, when swapping transmissions, it is best to match the engine with the transmission. The reason being, input shaft alignment with the clutch is crucial for clutch life and performance. Alignment can best be maintained with a OEM bell housing that has the proper input bearing retainer size and input shaft length. In other words, use a GM transmission with a GM engine and Ford transmission with a Ford engine. Since many Jeeps use the same Borg-Warner transmissions used in Ford vehicles, Ford transmissions generally work better with Jeeps. Quality after market bell housings exist to mate different engines with different transmissions, but they add to the cost and complexity of the conversion.

When replacing tires you of course must know the wheel diameter, but this will be stamped on the old tires. If you are browsing through a stack of wheels that are not stamped an easy way to determine the diameter is to measure the maximum diameter from rim to rim and then with a ruler measure the distance from the rim down to the bead seat. Subtract twice the distance which you measured down to the bead seat from the rim to rim diameter and you will have the correct wheel diameter. Wheel diameter is a critical consideration when changing or altering brake components. It is also believed by many that 15\" wheels have a superior bead design and better bead retention than 16\", 16.5\" or 17\" wheels.</p>"},{"location":"wheel/#wheel-width","title":"Wheel Width","text":"<p>The wheel width or rim width is the distance between the outside edges of the bead seat. Most popular rim width for 4x4s would be 6\", 7\", 7.5\", 8\" and 10\". Rims wider than this are usually only used on trucks with extreme overwidth tires. The tire manufacturer will publish guidelines for what rim width should be used with which tire. In general 7\" rims will comfortably work with tires up to 10.5\" wide, 8\" wide rims work for 9.5\" up to 12.5\" wide tires and 10\" wide rims are used for 12.5\" and wider. Many rims will not be available in width wider than 8\" and rims wider than 10\" are much more difficult to find.</p> <p>Rim width relative to tread width has an effect on bead retention when aired down and on the overall tire profile. In general a narrower wheel (from within the manufacturers guidelines) will result in a more rounded profile with a slightly smaller footprint but with slightly greater protection of the wheel. Narrower wheels also may retain the bead marginally better when aired down than will the wider wheels. Wider wheel provide a flatter tire profile and greater footprint. Since the rim is wider it will not be as protected from the rocks as would a narrower wheel with the same tire. The tire carcass will exert less pressure on the wider width bead when aired down and a wider wheel may thus be marginally more likely to lose a bead when pressures are low. Wider wheels, with less sidewall bulge, may reduce the rubbing of large tires on the springs at full turn.</p>"},{"location":"wheel/#backspacing","title":"Backspacing","text":"<p>Backspacing is the distance from the inside rim surface to the backside of the wheel mounting surface.

Winches must be very STRONG. Too little weight means too little metal used in the construction. Too much weight could mean that your front end will sag. A benefit of the Hydraulic winch is that it does weigh less.  Q. How do I select a winch for my truck?","text":"<p>A. The most important thing to consider when selecting a winch is whether it is capable of pulling 1.5 times the gross vehicle weight (GVW) of your vehicle (don't forget to take into account that 12% drop in pulling power for every extra wrap of cable on the drum - a 9000lb winch has a line pull of approx. 7000lbs on the third wrap). GVW is the real world weight of your vehicle, i.e. fully loaded. So fill up your gas tank, load up all those off-road goodies, tools, hi-lift jacks, people and go get your vehicle weighed. Q. What do the different winch gear systems mean and what difference will they make when I'm operating them? A. There are three common gearing systems, worm gear, spur gear and planetary gear. They all do the same job, gear down the high speed motor to a low speed high torque winch drum. The gear reduction ratio is by how much the motor's output revolutions are reduced for the spindle. The greater the reduction, the more revolutions the motor has to turn for one spindle revolution and the less the motor has to work for that revolution. The difference in the gearing systems is mainly in their transfer efficiency.</p> <p>The worm gear has a transfer efficiency of 35-40%. This causes the winch to be self-braking even under heavy loads, but this means the unit will need a clutch mechanism for free spooling. Worm gears offer the most reduction, very high reliability, built-in braking mechanism, and generally a slower winching speed.</p> <p>The spur and planetary gear systems have efficiencies of 75% and 65% respectively. This means they have a tendency to free spool when loaded, therefore, a braking mechanism is needed. Planetary gears are the most common and provide both strength and smooth operation with good resistance to torque loads.  Q. I've noticed while looking through the manufacturer's catalogs that there are different types of electric motors. What is the difference between series wound motors and permanent magnet motors? Is one better than the other? A. An electric motor basically has two major parts, the stator and the rotor (or armature). It is the job of the stator to produce a magnetic field which will cause the rotor to rotate when an electric current flows through it.</p> <p>In a permanent magnet motor, the stator uses permanent magnets. This means the current drain on the battery is lower than series wound motors (which uses field coils in the stator). Permanent magnet motors are good for light and medium duty winches, but winching time and load has to be carefully monitored as they tend to overheat. Series wound motors are used in heavier duty winches, but tend to cost more.  Q. Will my electrical system cope with the extra load of an electrical winch? A. For most pulls, yes. There a lot of people out there with one battery, stock alternator, and a winch. Keep in mind though that running a winch is the equivalent to moving your truck on the starter motor, there is a tremendous draw. Most electric winches draw around 400 amps at full load which is far more than even a high output alternator will produce. Stock alternators typically produce 40-90 amps at peak output and the battery will keep up for only so long. Because of this, many people install high output alternators and dual battery systems to support an electric winch.</p> <p>When shopping for a high output alternators, remember to consider alternator output at idle, these figures can differ wildly, especially on older models. Regardless of what alternator you have, it is a good idea to keep up the RPMs while you are winching if possible. Most alternators have peak outputs near cruising RPMS. Also, keep you truck running after winching to give your battery time to recover.</p> <p>Upgrading the battery or going to a dual battery system is also a good idea. The more cold cranking amps your battery (or batteries) produces, the longer you can pull without your engine running. An electronic battery management system is also a good idea to isolate the batteries.</p> <p>After you have got power to the winch you will need to get it back to the battery. Ensure your grounding system is capable and all connections are clean, this is where most systems waste power. The best grounding systems will use large diameter cables (such as welding cables), the battery negative post connects to the engine block, the alternator ground connects to the engine (usually through its case) and then the frame is connected to the engine using a grounding strap. The best bet is to connect the a ground directly from the winch to the battery.  Q. I want to be able to winch from either the front or the back of my truck, are the receiver mounted winches any good? A. Receiver mounted winches are very useful, but remember their static pull load is limited by the receiver they fit into. For a class III hitch that is 5000lbs. Because of this, receiver mounted winches are not really suitable for full sized trucks. Q. When I buy my winch, what comes with it, and what else do I need to start using it? A. Most winches come with nothing, but some places do a deal which includes the remote cable control and fairlead hawser. You will also need the mounting kit for your vehicle. I strongly recommend you buy the winch manufacturers kit. It has been designed for that winch and vehicle with all safety aspects considered. Home made winch mounts are disasters looking for a place to happen.</p> <p>Your winch will now work, but it is limited to straight line pulls between two vehicles. The addition of the following items will greatly increase your winch's usefulness - Tree saver straps (never wrap a cable directly round a tree, you will kill the tree and kink your cable), a couple of clevis pins, snatch blocks, a choke chain and of course thick leather gloves.</p> <p>Attach tow hooks to the frame on all four corners of your vehicle.  Q. What safety equipment will I need? A. You just need your leather gloves and common sense. Never handle the cable with bare hands, a frayed cable can cut skin to the bone. The most common winch accident is getting your fingers caught in the cable as the last of it winds onto the drum. Always use the remote control cable when winching, and keep every one out of range of the cable . Q. What other safety considerations are there? A. Be aware that a broken winch cable can have enough force in its whiplash to cut through a truck's roof and windshield. Imagine what would happen if the cable met a person. A cable that hits a small tree will tear the tree down. A cable that hits a large tree can wrap tightly around a tree so a person behind the tree is not necessarily safe. Solid objects such as hooks and snatch blocks will fly through anything, including a truck's hood, if a cable breaks. People should stand well out of range of the cable and never in line with the cable. Furthermore, if a cable breaks, the truck being winched may roll downhill, so never stand downhill of any vehicle being winched. Q. Is it common to break a winch cable? Should I carry a spare? A. No to both questions. A properly maintained cable is very reliable (see question about maintenance) and carrying a spare will only increase the risk of damaging it. Winch cable is aircraft grade cable and has a breaking strain of 32,000lbs - much higher than the capacity of the winch.</p> <p>It is much more common for for snatch blocks and anchor points to break because they were poorly rigged up. It is a good idea to drape a heavy cloth jacket over the cable to limit the whiplash if something snaps. If someone has to steer the vehicle being winched, then raise the hood for extra protection. Ensure all anchor points are firm.  Q. Is my winch maintenance free? A. Although many people seem to think the answer to this one is yes, the answer is really no! I have met a number of people in the mountains stuck, with a winch that won't work. A little care and preventative maintenance would have ensured its reliability.</p> <p>Your winch should be maintained on a regular basis. Lubricate all required points, inspect all mounts, pulleys, straps and clevis pins, check they are not damaged, or showing signs of fatigue, and are free of moisture. Inspect your remote control lead and electrical system for damage and chaffed insulation. Make sure all terminals are corrosion free and tight. After each trip unspool the cable. Check for kinks and frayed strands (damaged cables should be replaced). Lubricate cable with a chain and cable lubricant (normal grease will collect dirt) and wind back onto drum.  Q. What does using a snatch block achieve? A. Basically it doubles your available pulling power (in fact it's an increase of 85% after safety considerations). It will also allow you to perform pulls at an angle to your truck. People are rarely considerate enough to get stuck straight in front of you. Q. When I double up the winch line using the snatch block, where should I attach the return line. A. If the snatch block is attached to another vehicle, which you are trying to free, then the return line should be connected to a third vehicle or tree, to spread the load.</p> <p>If the snatch block is anchored to a tree and you are trying to free yourself, then the return line should be hooked onto your vehicle's frame. DO NOT hook it back on to the winch mount as this will effectively double the load on the mounting plate.  Q. What is the best way of anchoring my vehicle when I'm trying to winch another vehicle out of trouble? A. Anchor your vehicle to another vehicle or any other fixed object using your tow strap, tree saver, choker chain etc. The one thing to remember is attach the anchor strap to your vehicle at the same end as your winch, otherwise you may stretch your vehicle's frame. Often, simply hitting the brakes will be sufficient to hold your vehicle in place.</p>"},{"location":"winch/#electric-vs-hydraulic-vs-pto","title":"Electric vs. Hydraulic vs. PTO","text":"<p>Just when everyone thought the electric vs. PTO winch war was over, along comes the hydraulic winch. There are still pockets of resistance, but generally, electric winches have won out over the PTO winch. Enter the hydraulic winches and another set of advantages and disadvantages.</p> <p>The PTO (Power Take Off) winch is driven by a small drive shaft that is driven by a PTO adapter that bolts to the transmission or transfer case. Only certain transmissions and transfer cases have PTO ports (e.g. T-18, SM-465, Dana 18, ...). Most electric and hydraulic winches have only one speed, but with a transfer case PTO port, shifting gears can be used to change line speed, torque, and direction. Transmission PTO ports drive off the counter shaft, so they work in one direction and have one speed that can be varied by engine RPM. Since engine power drives the PTO winch, your engine must be working to operate a PTO winch. This is probably the biggest disadvantage of the PTO winch since your engine isn't likely to be running for long when your truck is upside down or under water in a raging river. Not long enough to run out the cable anyway.</p> <p>The electric winch does not require the engine to be running to work, which is it's biggest advantage. The big argument against the electric winch in the past was it would drain you battery and there was no way your alternator could provide sufficient power for a long pull. The automotive industry has made great improvements in alternator and battery technology over the past years which has given the advantage to the electric winch. Batteries have more power and alternators have higher outputs. An electric winch might even work if your truck is upside-down or under water.</p> <p>Some of the advantages of the hydraulic winch are pulling power, pull duration, and weight. The hydraulic winch runs off your existing power steering pump. There is no need to upgrade alternator of battery for the winch, but you may consider upgrading your power steering pump. If you don't have power steering, convert now, regardless of what winch you get. A hydraulic winch should be able to pull harder and longer than a electric winch with out over heating. Hydraulic winches are also much lighter than electric winches, putting less strain on your front axle and front springs.</p> <p>Hydraulic winches suffer from the same disadvantage as the PTO winch, neither works when the engine isn't running. The hydraulic winches I've seen have a real slow line speed, this could an advantage under some circumstances, but generally this is a disadvantage. There is a two speed model, but the high speed is not for use under load. Another disadvantage I've heard from people with hydraulic winches is the reduced ability to steer and winch at the same time.</p>"},{"location":"winch/d18pto/","title":"Jeep Winches: Koenig Dana 18 PTO Adapter","text":"<p> This is how the Koenig Dana 18 PTO adapter looks from behind.

There probably is a part that will perfectly replace the front yoke, but I do not know the part number.</p> <p>Here is the step-by-step process of replacing the yokes:</p> <ol> <li>Block tires so your Jeep doesn't roll away.</li> <li>Remove the driveshafts with 1/4\" 12 pt. socket</li> <li>Hold the old yoke with the pipe wrench while removing the yoke retaining nut with 1 1/8\" socket.</li> <li>Remove old yoke and slide on new yoke.</li> <li>Hold new yoke with pipe wrench while tightening yoke retaining nut to 120 ft/lbs (162 N/M)</li> <li>Reinstall drive shafts with U-bolts and tighten with 1/2\" wrench.</li> </ol> <p>I did the rear first and then removed the skid plate/cross member to do the front, after properly supporting the transmission of course. I think that the yoke retaining nuts should technically be replaced since they are locking nuts, but I reused mine with no problems.

Well many things make it desirable including:</p> <ul> <li>The \"Texas\" bolt pattern</li> <li>The 2.62 low range</li> <li>Rear center output</li> <li>Sturdy construction</li> <li>Short transmission adapter</li> </ul> <p>The \"Texas\" bolt pattern is the pattern on the input side which is the same pattern used on the Dana 20 and Dana 18. The only difference is on the Scout Dana 300, the bottom bolt is not used, only the four bolts on the side are used. Since it features this pattern, it is bolt compatible with any Jeep or Scout transmission that has a Dana 20 or Dana 18 attached to it.</p> <p>The Scout Dana 300 features a 2.62:1 low range just like the Jeep Dana 300. This is a big improvement over the the 2.03:1 low range of the Dana 20. If it doesn't sound like much difference to you, remember that gears are multiplicative. If have a Jeep T-18/Dana 20/3.54s combination for example, your crawl ratio is 6.32 * 2.03 * 3.54 or 45:1. If a Scout 300 was swapped in, the crawl ratio would be 6.32 * 2.62 * 3.54 or 59:1. The same would be true if you were running a wide ratio Scout T-19. Keep in mind that all Scout T-18s, some Scout T-19s, and some Jeep T-18s were close ratio.</p> <p>The Scout Dana 300 also has a center output which is transfers power straight through in two wheel drive high mode. The down side of this over an offset rear output like the Dana 18, is that the rear drive shaft angle is somewhat steeper. The good side is since the center output is straight through in 2H, it is quieter and longer lasting.</p> <p>Another feature of the Scout Dana 300 is it features the same sturdy construction as the Jeep Dana 300. The Scout 300 has a cast iron case and is gear driven. The only real difference between the Jeep and Scout Dana 300s is the input bolt pattern. The Scout Dana 300 also has a short rear tail housing like the early Jeep Dana 300s.</p> <p> You will not find a heavy duty drive train as short and low geared as a the Jeep T-18 and Scout Dana 300 combination. The Jeep T-18 used in late 70s CJs features a 6.32:1 first, short input shaft, and a transmission to transfer case adapter that is about 1\" long. The Scout Dana 300 bolts right up to the factory adapter as you can seen in this picture provided by Rick Boiros.

The Scout Dana 300 gear is different from the gear used with the Jeep and Scout Dana 20. The picture on the right is a Scout Dana 300 and Jeep Dana 20 input gear side by side. The Scout Dana 300 drive gear is no longer available and it will only fit on a transmission with a 1 3/8\" 6 spline output shaft.
