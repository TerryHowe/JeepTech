<p>
After running the same spring under axle (SUA) setup with a
shackle reversal for years, Mike Knorr was ready for a change.
His set up performed well, but the springs were getting tired
and Mike wanted something that took performance to the extremes.
A spring over axle (SOA) conversion was the obvious solution, but
Mike didn't want to give up his shackle reversal.  This article
is the first in a two part series on extreme suspension modifications.
It covers what went into his new front suspension including reworking
spring mounts, a long travel driveshaft, military wrapped spring packs,
custom shock towers for the longest RS9000 shocks available, and
high clearance steering with heim joints.</p>

<h2>Spring Mounts</h2>
<p>
<a href="/images/suspension/custcj/mkcj2.jpg"><img src="/images/suspension/custcj/mkcj2s.jpg" alt="fixed front spring hanger"></a>
<p>
Mike wanted to keep his shackle reversal while doing the SOA.  His
original shackle reversal system was relocated and raised to give a
better approach angle.  Almost two inches were taken off between
the spring eyes and the frame.  The bracketry was moved forwards
until the main spring eye was directly below the leading edge of
the frame.</p>
<p>

Mike fabricated new shack hangers out of heavy gauge tubing and 1/4" x 2 1/2"
mild steel.  First the edge of the flat stock was welded to the tubing, then
it was bent all the way around and welded to itself. After that the gap on
each side was welded shut and ground smooth.  It looks similar to a standard
rear shackle hanger, but it is heavier duty.  The shackle hangers were welded
to the frame after the shackle position was verified.</p>

<h2>Springs:</h2> 
<p>
<a href="/images/suspension/custcj/mkcj10.jpg"><img src="/images/suspension/custcj/mkcj10s.jpg" alt="Spring packs"></a>
Mike originally tried using some stock CJ rear springs, but they didn't have
enough arch for his needs.  Next Mike ordered from JC Whitney some heavy duty
CJ rear spring packs with military wrap.  These springs are real nice springs
for the cost.
<p>

The only down side to these springs is they came with cheesy clamps that would
get torn off quickly on rocks.  To prevent his packs from fanning out Mike had
some riveted on spring clamps added that are similar to what Jeep uses from
the factory.  While the packs were apart Mike painted them again. </p>

<h2>Steering:</h2>
<p>
<a href="/images/suspension/custcj/mkcj12.jpg"><img src="/images/suspension/custcj/mkcj12s.jpg" alt="Tie rod and drag link bracket"></a>
Mike designed a custom high clearance steering setup and had a friend who is
a machinist fabricate it.  It uses mid '70s Wagoneer knuckles and flame cut
arms for the drag link and tie rod.  Mike used the same setup that I used in
my <a href="/steer/soasteering/">High Clearance Steering</a>, except
he used 3/4" heim joints with a 40,000 lb tensile strength rating instead of
tie rod ends.  Mike also used some thick walled DOM tubing for the tie rod and
drag link.  One end was tapped for right hand threads and one for left to make
adjustments easier. The custom steering arms were designed with heim joints
in mind, but the pitman arm had to be drilled to fit the bolt. </p>

<h2>Shock towers and shocks:</h2>
<p>
Mike had Pat Hegleson at Custom Welding in Williston, ND build these shock
towers and cross brace.  The original front shock towers were cut off and
the new setup was mocked up.  With the new shock towers clamped in place
jack stands and a floor jack were used to contort the Jeep and test the
suspension flex.  Opposite corners were raised until a tire came off the
ground.  Clearances were noted and the position of the shock towers were
adjusted.  When Mike was happy with the shock tower placement, the shock
towers were welded in place.  The cross brace uses polyurethane bushings
to allow for flex and disassembly in case the motor needs to be removed.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>
I'd like to thank Mike Knorr for letting me shoot pictures
while I was supposed to be turning a wrench. I'd also like to
thank Myron Hanson for the use of his well equipped shop and
expert black smithing and metal working.  Pat Hegleson deserves
a big thanks for selling Mike the shock towers and Dave Kesky
deserves a thank you for doing most of the fabrication on Mike's 
steering arms.</p>
