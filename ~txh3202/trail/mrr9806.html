Just shortly after dawn (actually about 7:00 a.m.) 3 very sleepy sets of
vehicles with drivers showed up at McDonalds at the north end of
town.  Their assignment was an assault on Spring Creek. After some
serious discussion it was decided to change the destination and try the
Miller Rock Road, a map had been supplied by Adam Mehlberg to Paul who
was the trip leader.  Off down the road went the 3 vehicles carrying
Doug, Justin, Brian, Paul and Cindy...</p>

This road is just a bit hard to find as it looks to be someone's
driveway, but found it we did and up the hill we went.  Miller Rock Road
is not very hard but it is a pretty drive.  We did find ourselves lost
just a bit and ended up on a "dude" ranch and had to ask for some
information.  It seems that we weren't the only ones to have taken a
wrong turn as the week before another set of 4 wheelers had done the
same thing.  After talking to gentleman on the ranch we retraced our
"steps" and tried another route.  This took us down a steep hill to a
closed gate and we had to turn around and go back the way we came.
It was a bit silly as the highway was on the other side of the locked
gate.  Oh well, there you have Miller Rock Road...
