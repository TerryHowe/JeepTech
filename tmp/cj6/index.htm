1975 CJ-6 Tuned port 350, 700R4, NP241, Dana 44s (Scout II) front and rear
4.27s with Detroits. All riding on 38" TSL/SXs on Champion beadlocks.  1975
was the last year for domestic production of the CJ-6 and only around 2,000
were made that year.  This Jeep is the last of great Jeep.  The CJ-6 has
the same 103" wheelbase of the Scrambler(CJ-8), but it has a much better
departure angle.  This Jeep is truely unique and gets noticed where ever
it goes.
                                                                                
<h2>Engine</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0602.JPG"><img src="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0602_.JPG" align="right"></a>
I've always wanted a Jeep with a hot V8, so for this Jeep I had
<a href="http://www.mccabemotorsports.com/" target="_blank">Robbie
McCabe</a> build this engine for me.  Robbie does fantastic work
and is well known in the racing world.  The engine was an '88 L98
350 from a Firebird.  It was bored 30 over and the heads were ported
and polished.  The engine was balanced as well and all the parts
used in the engine where new except for the rods.  I have less
than 5,000 miles on the Jeep since the entire Jeep and this engine
were rebuilt.
<p>
<a href="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0604.JPG"><img src="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0604_.JPG" align="left"></a>
I've always thought the L98 was the the hottest looking V8 Chevy
ever made and I wanted to clean up that look.  The engine originally
had a MAF sensor and I converted it to use a MAP sensor.  This allowed
me to clean up the engine compartment and run a simple K&N cone filter.
I used a brand new wiring harness from Centech and placed the computer
behind the dash where it will stay dry.
<p>
The Jeep originally came with a 15 gallon fuel tank, so I built a
custom 23 gallon fuel tank for it and mounted the fuel pump inside
the tank.  I made an access port in floor for in tank fuel pump so
the pump can be accessed without dropping the tank.  This gives the
Jeep a good range between fuel stops.  I built the tank to maximize
clearance and it only hangs down a little bit more than the stock
15 gallon fuel tank.
<p>
The engine has an air conditioning compressor on it.  I was thinking
about hooking it up for on-board compressed air to inflate the tires,
but I haven't gotten around to that.  It has has a brand new alternator,
power steering pump, water pump, and idler pulley.
<p>
The engine uses engine mounts from Mountain Off Road Enterprises (M.O.R.E)
out of Rifle, Colorado.

<h2>Transmission</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0599.JPG"><img src="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0599_.JPG" align="right"></a>
I hooked the Chevy 350 to a 700R4 from a '91 Suburban.  This is one
of the later 700R4s, not the '86 and older ones that are not very
reliable.  For fuel economy, it has a lock up torque converter that
the computer supports.  The kickdown for the transmission is hooked
up and works.  The case for this transmission is the much desired
"brace case".  The torque converter cover is aluminum with the holes
for the braces in it, but the egine oil pan does not have the brace
holes.
<p>
I hooked up one of those beautiful Lokar shifters for the transfer
case.  It shifts very cleanly and looks great.

<h2>Transfer Case</h2>
<p>
The transfer case I used for this project was the NP241.  The transfer
case came out of a '91 Suburban, it is passenger drop, and it has something
like a 2.72:1 low range.  I used a trail shaft shortening kit from JB
Conversions on the back of the case.  The front and rear outputs are 1310
CV joints for both drive shafts.
<p>
I laid the engine in the Jeep so that the transfer case could be clocked
flat and I left enough space so an Atlas could bolt right in.  I decided
to install the transfer case in the stock position though and used the
factory transfer case brace to the engine.
<p>
In the picture above, you can see the linkage for the transfer case.  I
used the original shifter from the Suburban and it looks and works like
it was put in there from the factory.

<h2>Axles</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0608.JPG"><img src="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0608_.JPG" align="right"></a>
This Jeep features Dana 44s front and rear with 4.27:1 ring and pinion
and Detroit lockers.  The axles are out of a late 70s International
Scout II.  The gears axles where professional built by
<A href="http://www.predator4wd.com/" target="_blank">Predator Four
Wheel Drive</a> in Colorado Springs.  The front axle was narrowed 3" by
Predator so that it is the same width as a wide track CJ.  Both axles
are around 58" wheel wot wheel.  This makes the Jeep more stable on
side hills and gives better articulation.  The front axle uses the
stock CJ knuckles so that the steering still works like a regular CJ.

<h2>Tires & Wheels</h2>
I used a set of Champion beadlocks and 38" Super Swamper TSL/SXs on
this Jeep.  The beadlocks allow me to air down those super Swampers
on the trail with no fear of losing a bead.  The TSL/SX is an incredible
off-road tire that is very tough.

<h2>Suspension</h2>
<p>
The stock suspension on this Jeep used the narrow leaf springs common
in Jeeps built before 1976.  I decided to convert the Jeep to use
the wider and more reliable Wrangler springs.  The BDS 4" lift springs
use a military wrap front and rear, so in the unlikely event
that a spring breaks, the axle will stay located.  That is the feature
that I really like about these springs, I haven't seen that from any
other spring manufacturer.
<p>
I've always been a big fan of the adjustable Rancho 9000s, so I
used those shock absorbers on all four corners.  I think the rear shocks
are use a 10" shock and the fronts are a 12".  This is a ton of travel
for a Jeep like this.  I alternated the shock mount position on the
rear axle to control spring wrap, although spring wrap is generally not
a problem with spring under vehicles and it doesn't seem to be a problem
for this vehicle.
<p>
I used the Ford shock mount towers on all four corners to mount the shocks.
Ford makes a very nice, simple, and clean shock mount tower.  I had to
slightly shorten the rear towers to clear the tub.

<h2>Frame</h2>
<a href="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0594.JPG"><img src="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0594_.JPG" align="right"></a>
The frame is a custom 2x4 steel tube frame built by
<a href="http://www.rockware.net/" target="_blank">RockWare</a>.
The original frame for this Jeep had some cracks and it was not boxed.
This frame is much more reliable and stronger than the stock frame.  RockWare
does beautiful metal work.  They added a winch mount to the frame and shackle
hangers on all four corners.  The also built the transmission cross member
and skid plate.
<br clear="all">

<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0598.JPG"><img src="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0598_.JPG" align="right"></a>
The interior the Jeep was coated with Herculiner to give a tough, durable
finish that would withstand the dirt you would expect in a Jeep.  It makes
it easy to clean up and it always looks great.  I've used the product in
3 other Jeeps I owned and I've always been very pleased.  Sorry about the
leaves in that picture, I left the back window up.
<p>
<a href="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0606.JPG"><img src="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0606_.JPG" alight="right"></a>
I slightly modified the original seat brackets so that I could install
a set of Bestop Super Seats.  These seats are very comfortable and they
are vinyl so that don't absorb water.  The backs have a little storage
pocket and the recline.  The passenger side seat still lifts up to access
the tool box under the passenger seat.
<p>
<a href="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0600.JPG"><img src="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0600_.JPG" align="right"></a>
I wanted to keep the dash stock looking, so I repaired any problems with
the wiring harness and replaced all the burnt out bulbs.  I replaced all
the lights with new ones for the "wipers", "hazards", "lights", ...  I
also put the billet knobs on the heater controls, wiper, and hazards
controls.  the defrost duct was replaced with one of those aftermarket
plastic ones.
<p>
For secure storage and for the stereo, I installed a Tuffy Console.  The
radio is a marine radio with CD player.
<p>
<a href="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0603.JPG"><img src="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0603_.JPG" align="left"></a>
The roll cage is built entirely of 1 3/4" DOM 0.120 wal tube.  There are
gussets on the important corners and it is a six point cage.  The cage
extends over the back square to protect passengers in the back.
<p>
The Jeep has race style lap belts, but the roll cage has a provision to
run a 3 point seat belt.  I just like the lap belts better.  The regular
shoulder belts would bolt right in.
<p>
I modified the battery holder to hold an Odessey drycell.  Very nice
battery and no messy acid all over the place.
<br clear="all">

<h2>Winch</h2>
<a href="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0593.JPG"><img src="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0593_.JPG" align="right"></a>
This Jeep has a Warn 8274 winch on a custom mount.  This winch is by far the
best trail winch out there, I've run them for years with great reliability.
The winch has a roller fairlead and fresh cable.  This winch hasn't seen
any service except for my trip to Holy Cross when I needed to use it a
couple of times because of the deep snow.  I wired a controller for the
winch into the cab and there is a regular remote that comes with the winch.
<br clear="all">

<h2>Brakes</h2>
<a href="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0605.JPG"><img src="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0605_.JPG" align="right"></a>
For the brakes, I used a power brake booster and master cylinder from a
'90 S-10.  I redrilled the swing arm pedal for the booster and fabricated
a push rod for it.
<br clear="all">

<h2>Steering</h2>
<a href="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0607.JPG"><img src="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0607_.JPG" align="right"></a>
This Jeep originally had manual steering, but I used a power steering box
I had from my old '81 CJ-7.  I bought a power steering pump from AGR
and installed it and used the hoses from the CJ-7.  The steering is very
nice.  I used the stock steering column and a Grant steering wheel.  In
order to eliminate bump steer, I installed a 4" drop pitman arm.  This 
keeps the tie rod and drag link pretty much level.  The steering box is
held onto the frame with a tough steering box bracket from M.O.R.E.
<br clear="all">

<h2>Body</h2>
Parts of the body I had sandblasted (like the hood) and the rest of it,
I used a wire wheel to take it down to bare metal.  I used an etching
primer to start.  After that coat, a regular primer, then color, and
then the clear.  I did most of the prep work and and my friend who is
a professional painter actually shot the paint.  The finish is real
eye catching.
<p>
<a href="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0609.JPG"><img src="http://www.jeeptech.com/ForSale/cj6/DCP_0609_.JPG" align="left"></a>
The original tailgate was badly rusted and I happened to have a tailgate
from a Willys '45 CJ-2A.  There is a number on the side of the tailgate
and this is about the 850th tailgate Willys ever made.  The military
Jeeps didn't have a tailgate.  It is kind of neat to have the "Willys"
stamp in the back even though AMC owned Jeep in 1975.
<p>
The body is protected with 3/16" rocker protection and 3/16" armored
corners.  I welded the corners in and painted them to get a nice clean
finish.  I used a cool round fuel filler from a '77 CJ-7 I happend to
have.  It gives the Jeep a more modern look and it left room for recessed
lights in the rear.  It also lets the fuel go into the tank a little easier.
I installed two reverse lights instead of the stock one back up light and
it makes it easy to see when you are reversing.  I purchased the reverse
light switch for the Lokar shifter.
<p>
The hood is louvered so the engine runs cool.  I used brand new hood catches
and mirrors.  The mirrors have quick releases on them so you can move them
out of the way in the garage or on the trail.  The front parking lights are
also brand new.  I converted the grill to use the later CJ parking lights.

<h3>Holy Cross</h3>
<p>
I haven't really done any hard wheeling with this rig.  I took the Jeep
out to Ouray this summer and ran some of the scenic trails like Poughkeepsie
and Engineer.  The snow run up Holy Cross was the hardest trail I've done.
It was a lot of fun up there June 4th:

<p>
It is hard to beat this rig for a rig you can drive on the street and do some fun trails. Awesome camping rig as well, plenty of room.  Some of the build up of this rig were documented on <a href="http://www.4x4wire.com/jeep/projects/deep6/">4x4Wire.com</a>.
