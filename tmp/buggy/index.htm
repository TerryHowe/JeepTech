It is kind of a tangerine orange with a platinum metal flake in the clear coat. The hood and grill are the Liberty set made by Campbell Enterprises. This rig complies with all UROC rules. It only has one seat in it, but it is 46" wide, so you could squeeze another seat in there if you wanted.

This rig climbs better than any rig I've ever had. This rig did that A-5 obstacle from Farmington 2001 which I could never get my other vehicles up. It does obstacles like the money pit in Farmington easily.
