<p>
One day I was talking to my grandmother, Elizabeth Gates, and I thought, "Wow.  Grandma 
and I are worlds apart.
We don't have very much in common."  That led me to wonder what we did have in
common.  What was it like growing up earlier in the century?  What was it like to see 
the various inventions and changes in the world?  What was her family life like and
who were her friends?  What kind of hobbies or interests did she have?  Just who is
this woman?
</p>

<p>
I decided that I wanted to begin to find out, so I scheduled an extended vacation
and drove out east to "interview" Grandma.   Deciding where to begin was difficult -
I had never done an interview before - but starting with the family facts was an
easy place.    What wasn't so easy was to get more of the personal information from 
Grandma - her thoughts, likes, dislikes, passions.  Grandma has a very great quality
of accepting her life as it is and as it was.  She doesn't use
phrases such as "what if..." or "if only...".  What she does say a lot is, "That's
how it was.".
</p>

<p> 
I learned a lot about Grandma, but also about myself, too.  I learned that I have
preconceptions about certain events and I never bother to see if my preconceptions
are accurate.  I learned that I don't know the members of my family that well.
I learned to listen better.
</p>
<p>
I'm very glad that I took the time to get to know my grandmother better and to 
learn more about my heritage and my family.  What I have compiled can be considered
an overview of my grandmother's life and I encourage others to add to it or share
with me other family experiences.
