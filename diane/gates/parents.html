<p>
My grandmother's parents are Adolph and Rosalia.  They
are European immigrants who moved to Northeastern
Pennsylvania to pursue the American Dream.
</p>
<p>
Adolph Dmochowski was born in Poland on November 11, 1884
to Blanche and Paul.   As a young man, he worked the family
farm.  He came to this country
when he was about 20 years old.  
He came to Pennsylvania right away, from what Grandma 
remembers being told, and starting working in the coal mines.
He worked in the mines his entire life.

<p>
Rosalia Rasimowicz was born in Lithuania on September 4, 1885
to Petronella and Casimir.  She moved to this country when she was about 21 years old.  
Her sisters Agatha and Anna also came to live in the United States except Anna moved
back to Lithuania on her husbands insistence.
Rosalia first lived in Scranton and then moved to Pittston.  Finally, she
moved to Plains where she lived with her sister, Agatha, and worked at General Hospital.
</p>

<p>
Agatha had a boarding house and Adolph was living there when
Rosalia moved in to live with her sister.
That is how Rosalia and Adolph met.  They eventually married on April 30, 1911.
