<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">For Grandma Gates, October 6, 1999</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is said that our first teachers are our parents – therefore, their first teachers were their parents – our Grandparents!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We grandchildren had the fortune to be taught by our grandmother.  Here is just some of what she taught us:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Our grandmother taught us Love.  She has nine grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.  Throughout our lives she has loved us immensely – equally!  She taught us to love others the same way.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Our grandmother taught us Kindness.  She was kind to everyone.  She never spoke ill of anyone and would go out of her way to help those who needed help.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;Our grandmother taught us Devotion.  She was devoted to her family and most importantly to her God.  She cared so much for her family and worked hard to keep us all close – to her and to each other.  Her devotion to God and Jesus Christ was an inspiration to all.  Her devotion came through how she imparted her beliefs on her family members, her work and dedication to her parish – SS Peter and Paul and her unwavering love of God through her everyday living.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;As with great teachers – when we have left them or they have left us – we continue to learn from them – just the thought of them gives us inspiration to continue to learn.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#9;So it is with Grandma.  She has left us – physically – but we all will continue to learn and do things in our life – because just the thought of her will inspire us all to do so!</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>We will continue to learn how to Love.  Everyone – immensely as she did!</LI></P></UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>We will continue to learn how to find ways to be kind – to all, as she did!</LI></P></UL>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>We will continue to learn how to be more devoted – to each other and especially to God and Jesus Christ – just as she continues to do now in her heavenly home!</LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will miss you grandma – but we know that you will always be with us!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We LOVE you and always will!</P>
