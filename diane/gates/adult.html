Elizabeth and Ken lived with Ken's mother for the first 6 months of 
their marriage.   They moved to Larksville over the garage that Grandpa's
family owned.  He worked there as a mechanic.
</p>

<p>
Grandma got pregnant soon after getting married.  Grandma didn't know
where babies came from when she got married or even when she was pregnant.
"People didn't talk about these things."  Betty was born on August 31, 1935.  
</p>

<p>
Grandma had Betty over at her mother's house with the doctor attending.
She remembers starting to get up to see her newborn daughter and the
doctor pushing her down and admonishing, "I'll show you the baby.".
Grandma stayed there for two weeks, and the first week she stayed upstairs
the entire time.  Babci always helped with all of her grandchildren.
</p>

<p>
Grandma's second daughter, Dorothy, was born in February, 1939.  She
had her in the hospital and stayed for two weeks.   It cost $30 total to have
a baby in the hospital in those days.  The Germans invaded Poland
in September of that year.
</p>

<p>
During World War II, Grandma was busy raising her family and being a homemaker. 
Her brothers Eddie and Hank were fighting in the war in the Pacific.
When Grandma was pregnant with her third child,  Grandpa was going to be drafted.
They moved back to Plains at this time so that she can be closer to her
family.
</p>

<p>
In 1943, Grandpa took the enlistment tests and did very well.  He was in 
conversation with the navy recruiter about jobs repairing machines
on the base.   He ended up not being drafted because mechanics were 
needed in the States since no new cars were being made.  Grandma had
Cathy in August, 1943.

<p>
The Gates rented houses in Hillside and on St. David Street until 1949
when they purchased the house on Mack Street for about $5,000.  Grandma
lived there for about 50 years.
</p>

<p>
During the years that Grandma raised the children and was a homemaker, she
occasionally worked outside the home.  For example, she would find work when
they needed a new appliance or extra money for something.  Shortly after
having Cathy, she worked at Dutch Masters in Wilkes Barre.  She also worked
at the garment factory in Wilkes Barre.
</p>

<p>
When her children were growing up, the family took very few vacations together.  In fact, Grandma only
remembers two, one was to Michigan to see her brothers and one was
to Palisades Park, NY to see a cousin.
</p>

<p>
As her daughters grew up, married, and had children,  Grandma enjoyed being
a grandmother.  I remember traveling to Grandma's house almost every weekend
and for every holiday.  All the aunts, uncles, and cousins would be there.
It wan't until she was a grandmother that she began to vacation more. 
She went to Disneyworld once and to Long Beach Island every summer for
a number of years.
</p>

<p>
In 1984, Grandma's twin sister, Bede passed away.  In 1988 she lost her
husband.  These were very sad times for her and she experienced depression.
</p>

<p>
Grandma's later times were spent cooking, reading, watching TV, and 
visiting with family.  She was active in her church, St's Peter and 
Paul, where she was a member her entire life.   She attended Senior
Citizen meetings and took the occasional club trip to Atlantic City or
Wildwood.  She slowed down a bit in later years because
of aging health problems, but she always was in good health and she bounced back well from
illness.  For example, when she was 71 she had triple bypass surgery and recovered
surprisingly well for someone at her age.
