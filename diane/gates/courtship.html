<p>
Elizabeth first met Kenneth Gates at her sister Stella's wedding.
He was invited by Bede who knew him from a group of friends
that hung out together at The Heights.
</p>
<p>
Grandpa had dated Bede's friend, Helen, a few times when he met Grandma.  He was
interested in dating Grandma, but it was Helen's birthday so he
dated her one more time because he didn't want to get a
reputation as a cheapskate (breaking up with a girl to avoid buying a present).  
Then he asked Grandma out and she
kept saying no, because she was friends with Helen.  But, Grandpa was persistent
and kept asking.
Finally, Grandma found out that he wasn't dating Helen anymore and she agreed to a date.
</p>
<p>
Elizabeth wasn't allowed to see Grandpa, so they would not meet
at her house.  Grandma's mother didn't approve because 
Ken was Protestant and the Dmochowskis were very Catholic.
When great grandma (baki, in Polish) caught on that Elizabeth was dating
Ken, she requested that he pick her up at the house from now on.
She still didn't approve of them dating.
</p>

<p> 
On their dates they would go to the movies, dancing, or
for rides.  Ken proposed to Elizabeth on Easter in 1934.  Grandma tried
to keep that under wraps, too, except Bede blabbed.
They scheduled the wedding for Thanksgiving, 1934.  Babci was
preparing a dinner reception for the family and friends, but
all the while threatening that she was going to break up the
wedding.  She even told the priest that.  Grandma and Grandpa
eloped on Nov 10, 1934 to ensure that the marriage did happen.
They got married by a priest in the rectory.
</p>

<p>
The night of their wedding, Ken and Elizabeth went on a double
date with Bede and John to see The Gay Divorcee.  That night, 
Grandma went home as if nothing was different.  The next day,
Ken came to her house with a suitcase to get her.  The moved
in temporarily with Ken's mother.  Great Grandma still prepared a
Thanksgiving Dinner wedding reception for the family.
