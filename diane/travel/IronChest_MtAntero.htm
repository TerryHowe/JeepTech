<p>Chaffee County is home to the Upper Arkansas Valley region
&#150; a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts. From the
Arkansas River to the many peaks rising above 14,000 feet,
outdoor fun at many altitudes can be had on foot, on horseback,
in 4-wheel drive vehicles, in a boat, or on your derrier soaking
in hot springs.</p>

        <td><p align="left">In the 1860s, mining brought many
        settlers to this area. Aptly enough, our exploration of
        this region starts by taking a 4-wheel drive vehicle
        off-road to Iron Chest mine. According to <u>Guide to
        Colorado Backroads &amp; 4-Wheel Drive Trails</u> by
        Charles A. Wells (FunTreks, Inc, 1998), Iron Chest is
        rated a black diamond, mostly because of the first half
        mile.Lifts, winches, and lockers are recommended.</p>
        <p align="left">The trail is about 2 ½ miles, and travel
        time really depends on your vehicle set-up.The trail
        rises to above tree line and features old mines, mining
        equipment, and structures where the miners used to
        live.Past the mine, you can continue up Chrysolite
        Mountain, peaking at 12,822 feet, and get good views.The
        last several hundred yards to the top of Chrysolite is a
        hike, since the vehicle trail ends nearby some old mining
        structures and equipment.</p>
        <p align="left">Closeby to Iron Chest is Mount Antero
        rising to 14,269 feet. You can take a four-wheel drive
        vehicle very close to the top of Antero, and hike the
        rest to the peak. This area is popular for bikers,
        hikers, and 4-wheelers. Along the trail up to Mount
        Antero, there are several beautiful free (primitive)
        camping spots and wildlife. The marmots were in abundance
        above tree-line.</p>

        <td>It is better to start early in the day to see these
        high altitude destinations due to thunderstorms, with
        lightening, that roll through later in the day. We drove
        to the end of the vehicle trail below Mount Antero at
        around 4:30 and decided not to hike the several hundred
        yards to the top, because of lightning strikes very close
        to us. Also, the higher altitude trails in Colorado are
        snow covered for most of the year. Depending on the
        season, mid-July through early September are your best
        bets for avoiding snow. During June and late-September
        you start to push your luck with the weather. </td>
