<p class=MsoTitle>When I didn’t go to Disney</p>

<p class=MsoTitle>by Diane Howe</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My family and I had a trip planned to visit Disney World in
Florida at the end of September, 2001 and we didn’t go.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It wasn’t because terrorists had just
crashed planes into American buildings that represented security, freedom, and
capitalism, bringing them down and killing 5600 people doing so, shaking up the
world we live, making us afraid and wanting to stay home.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But, rather, it is because my mom collapsed
on the floor in the kitchen one evening, 58 years old with a pulse rate of 40,
and was rushed to the hospital after a 9-1-1 call.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was to meet my mom and Bernie, sis, and my 3 nieces in
Disney for a long-planned vacation get-away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This was totally my mom’s dream.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>She was treating her granddaughters to the fantasy world of Disney,
where mice were bigger than people and can talk and get their picture taken
with you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Where parades lead by
princesses are a matter of course and Main Street has candy shops and toys and
perfectly manicured sidewalks and well kept shops and anything a little girl or
boy can dream of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She was living to see
their faces light up when they saw Mickey or Cinderella’s castle or their surprise
when they rode some thrilling ride.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She
had been planning this since Mary, my six year old niece, was born and, from
the reports that I hear, as long as religious fundamentalists had been planning
their rides of doom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After September 11, my sister and I had several
conversations about whether we should take the trip to Florida at the end of
the month like we had planned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
</span>Actually, we knew we wanted to go, but we were dealing with whether it
was appropriate or not and how guilty we would feel doing something that would
actually be a good time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Especially, my
sister pointed out, how bad she felt about all those children who lost parents
in the tragedy and would never even get to go to Disney with them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span>I talked about how I try not to let fear
stop me and, if we didn’t go, wouldn’t we be doing exactly what the terrorists
wanted?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>My family was driving to
Florida from their homes in Pennsylvania so flying for them wasn’t an
issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was flying in from Colorado
and had no qualms about doing so figuring security was extreme after the
attacks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We decided to go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The week before I was to meet them in Florida, my mom
collapsed in the kitchen where she was getting a midnight snack.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She was diagnosed with diabetes about 10
years ago, and probably had it years before being diagnosed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Within hours of going to the hospital the
doctors operated and gave her a pacemaker in a surprisingly simple
operation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She was released from the
hospital on a Tuesday and the doctors recommended that she not leave for
Florida on Thursday as planned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>I
decided to travel to Pennsylvania and see my mom with the few days I had
arranged off from work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Flying at the end of September was a definite different
experience than I had ever experienced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The closest thing was flying in Central America or Europe, where armed
guards are already part of the scenery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The weirdest thing was it was on our own soil.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Before going through airport security, I grabbed a bagel and
cream cheese to eat later and wondered if I should put a plastic knife in my
purse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I decided, yes, I’m not going to
allow terrorists have me get my fingers sloppy and I put the knife with the
bagel in my purse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The X-ray machines at the airport picked up my nail clippers
and my bag was searched.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I showed the
airport employee where the clippers were and he showed me the metal file that
folded out from them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It never even
occurred to me to use something like that as a weapon.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I told him he can keep them, as I tried very
hard not to look like a terrorist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I
started getting nervous about the plastic knife, but they didn’t bother with
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was very alert and looked at everyone on the plane as I
found my seat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>During the meal service
on the flight, there were only plastic utensils.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Later, I realized that all the food places at the airport had
plastic utensils.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Another minor shift
from my previous reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we were approaching Newark, I remembered that you can see
downtown NYC from the airport but I was on the wrong side of the plane to
see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The attacks seemed even closer now
that I traversed the miles from Colorado in a few short hours.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The guy across the aisle from me pulled
out<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>a camera and started shooting out
the window of the plane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a clear day in Newark and I filed into the terminal
to the windowed walkway leading to the main terminal.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">   </span>I had to look several times before realizing that I indeed was
viewing the downtown Manhattan skyline.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I kept thinking I was seeing Newark because the scene without the Twin
Towers looked so alien.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The gap inside
me grew to the size of the gap in the skyline and I started to cry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It used to be that the World Trade Center commanded the
lower Manhattan skyline, but not anymore.  It used to be that airlines gave
proper utensils during flight meals, but not anymore.  It used to be that
people weren't afraid before going to the Post Office or going to work, but
not anymore.   It used to be that Mommies seemed strong, would live 
forever, and stop anything bad from happening, but not anymore.
