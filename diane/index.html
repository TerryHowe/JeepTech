I am a computer programmer living and playing in Colorado Springs.  My life is about leaving footprints, not butt prints.  My motto is "Do what you love and love what you do".

This site records some of those footprints that I mentioned.  One is a trip I took to Honduras to help with <A HREF="/diane/honduras">Hurricane Mitch cleanup</A> and another is the 3 weeks I spent with my grandmother to record <a href="/diane/gates">her history</A>.
