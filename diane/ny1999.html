<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">As we approach the new millennium
at warp speed (it seems like I just sat down to write last year's Christmas
letter), I can't think of anything better than to think of all the loved
ones in our lives and wish you all a Happy New Year!</FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">Speaking of warp speed, you're not
speaking of Terry's 1945 CJ2A which he finished putting together earlier
this year and has been 4-wheeling ever since.&nbsp; Nor are you speaking
of Diane's 1959 Studebaker that she got in September.&nbsp; No matter,
speed isn't the only thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diane plans to cut her teeth
on the simple machinery of the Studebaker and Terry, well you know, Terry
is a total jeep-aholic.&nbsp; In any event, Diane and Terry will have vehicles
that are drivable on New Years Day.</FONT>
<P>Speaking of which Terry and Diane are taking this Y2K bug very seriously
(don't believe it for a minute).&nbsp; Everyone is invited to their New
Year's Eve bash this year and plenty of candles and flashlights are on
hand.&nbsp; Diane has been stockpiling champagne ever since her vacation
to France earlier this year.&nbsp; Yes, very serious indeed.
<P>Terry and Diane both left MCI in April.&nbsp; Terry is in a little company
that does voice over internet software switches and Diane is at a company
called Concert.&nbsp; Concert just became legally cleared as a joint global
venture between British Telecom and AT&amp;T, so it is like she is "almost"
working for AT&amp;T again.&nbsp; It also serves her yen for traveling
since some travel (to England and Virginia ) is involved.&nbsp; Terry's
appetite for being a hard core software developer is being sated at Vsys.
<P>Terry achieved two badges of honor for any serious jeeper this year.&nbsp;
One is wheeling the Rubicon in California in the summer, the other is rolling
on the side his CJ2A on an extreme trail here in Colorado (no injuries,
except pride).&nbsp; He is busy participating in two 4-wheeling clubs and
helping start a new online magazine venture at www.jeepwire.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Diane is serving the local Society of Women Engineers section as president
this year and also organizing a project to develop an engineering web site
made possible by a grant from Exxon Education Foundation.
<P>Together, Terry and Diane play coed soccer together and just love playing
together in Colorado.&nbsp; Come out and join us anytime!
