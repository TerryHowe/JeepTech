# Jeep Winches: Koenig Dana 18 PTO Adapter

[![Dana 18 Koenig PTO adapter back](../img/winch/kob_.jpg)](../img/winch/kob.jpg) This is how the Koenig Dana 18 PTO adapter looks from behind. The adapter would bolt on at a slight angle so that the shift lever would be more upright. [![Dana 18 Koenig PTO adapter side](../img/winch/kos_.jpg)](../img/winch/kos.jpg) From the side you can see how relatively thin the adapter is. A small chain inside the aluminum case takes power from the drive gear and transfers it to the PTO shaft gear.

The light area is the input shaft for the adapter, the output is on the right.
