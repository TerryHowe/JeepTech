The bumper installed on the CJ-6. It fits nice and snug over the front cross member and the stubby design lets the tire climb rocks.

The winch installed on the bumper and wired up. You can be sure that cable will never be that neat ever again.

I heard through a fellow Internet Jeeper that Predator Four Wheel Drive in Colorado Springs was running a special on some brand new Warn 8274 winches. The winches were the old style with the old motor and old solenoid pack, but they were only $699. I had the same winch on my flat fender and CJ-7 for years and I loved it. I couldn't pass up the the opportunity to put one on my CJ-6.

A lot of people will ask me if they have any more of these winches. I'm sorry to say, the answer is no. There were only a limited number and they sold pretty fast. When these deals come around, it is well worth jumping on them.

My CJ-6, also known as Deep Six, is mostly stock with a single battery and the 258 has the stock alternator. The alternator is the "heavy duty" version producing 60 or so amps. The alternator seams to do pretty well with this winch, I didn't see a reason to do an upgrade it. It would be nice to have a dual battery, but I knew my single Interstate battery would do the job in most situations.

[I happened to have my RockWare
Bumper](../projects/cj-7/rockware98.md)from my '81 CJ-7 sitting around and this was the perfect opportunity to put it back in action. I did have to slightly modify the bumper to work with the CJ-6 though. The frame rails are the same width between the CJ-6 and the CJ-7, but the bolt lay out is a bit different. These differences would be the same for any '72-'76 CJ vs any '77-'86 CJ. One of the bolts in the side is in a different place, so I drilled both sides of the bumper/winch mount for the new location.
The other difference was with the way the steering box attaches. The RockWare bumper sits low over the front cross member which works on the CJ-7, but on the '72-'76 CJs the steering box bracket has bolts through the top. These bolts hit on the bumper/winch mount and prevented it from going down far enough. To solve this problem, I used a small hole saw to cut out the top to provide space for the steering box bracket bolt heads.

After the bumper/winch mount was attached, it was easy to bolt up the winch and run the cables to the battery. The winch saw a lot of action on a work trip out on Hacket Gulch. We were clearing up a bunch of dead fall and blocking off illegal trails and I had to winch several times pulling dead trees out of the forest. The whole system worked well even with the stock alternator and one battery. The winch also saved me when frame flex caused me to loose my clutch linkage.
