# Jeep Winches: Transmission PTO Adapter

Most heavy duty transmissions have PTO ports onto which a PTO adapter can be bolted. Some examples of transmissions with PTO ports include the T-18, T-19, NP435, NV4500, SM465, and SM420. The PTO adapters I've seen all have a front and rear output.

Since these transmission PTO adapters are driven off of the countershaft, their speed and direction is not effected by the gear that the transmission is in. Only engine RPM can be used to change the speed. Normally, the PTO is only used with the transmission in neutral.

It can be torn apart and rebuilt for rear or front output. The unit can also be mounted so the shaft is high or low and the shift lever can be mounted on either side. ![Transmission PTO adapter](../img/winch/t18pto03.jpg "Transmission PTO adapter") Back view of transmission PTO adapter on CJ T-18.
