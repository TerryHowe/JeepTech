# Project Pieces and Parts - Over Drive*
The Warn (aka Saturn) Overdrive is a real treat for any flat fender. It bolts into the PTO port and works in all forward and reverse gears in high and low range. Since I have a 3 speed transmission, I have 6 forward and 2 reverse gears with the low range from the transfer case. The overdrive doubles that giving me 12 forward and 4 reverse gears. Of course I probably won't really use all the options.

The picture on the right is of a Dana/Spicer 18 with the the cover of the PTO port removed. The overdrive bolts onto the PTO port and to the transmission output shaft. It replaces the transfer case drive gear with a planetary gear set that has a 0.75:1 reduction. When it is disengaged it is 1:1 like normal operation.

The overdrive only works with the offset rear output Spicer 18 transfer case. It will allow me to gear the axles low and still cruise comfortably on the highway.
