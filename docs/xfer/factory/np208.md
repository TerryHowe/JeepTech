# NP208

The NP208 has a aluminum case and an appearance similar to many other chain driven New Process transfer cases. It should have a tag on the back saying New Process Gear, Model 208. It is chain driven transfer case with a 23 spline input and standard round bolt pattern. The output for the front driveshaft is on the drivers side. Low range is around 2.62 and high is 1.00.

### Usage

Full size Cherokees used the NP208 from '80-'83 and the J-trucks used it from '80-'86 or '87. The NP208 was the "Command-Trac" option for full size Jeeps during this time period.
