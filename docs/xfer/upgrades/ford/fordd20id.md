# Ford Dana 20

[![Early Bronco Dana 20 front](/images/xfer/updates/ford/br20b_.jpg)](/images/xfer/updates/ford/br20b.jpg) [![Early Bronco Dana 20 rear](/images/xfer/updates/ford/br20a_.jpg)](/images/xfer/updates/ford/br20a.jpg) 

The Ford Dana 20 transfer case is gear driven with a cast iron case. It was used in early Broncos from 1966 until 1977 and it was used in some Ford pickups. It is drivers drop and it was available with a couple different low range ratios all around 2.4:1.

The Ford Dana 20 looks a lot different than the Jeep Dana 20. The Jeep Dana 20 is passenger drop of course, but that isn't the only difference. Parts from the Ford Dana 20 can be used convert a Jeep Dana 20 to have a better low range. Two write ups on this conversion are located at [ http://www.off-road.com/~jweed/transfer.html](https://www.off-road.com/~jweed/transfer.html) and [ http://www.srv.net/~jrcase/mod20.html](https//www.srv.net/~jrcase/mod20.html)

[![Jeep and Early Bronco Dana 20 rear](/images/xfer/updates/ford/br20c_.jpg)](/images/xfer/updates/ford/br20c.jpg) The rear view of the Jeep Dana 20 and the early Bronco Dana 20. You can see the case is completely different. The shift rails are in different places. The rear yoke has been removed from the Bronco Dana 20. [![Jeep and Early Bronco Dana 20 front](/images/xfer/updates/ford/br20d_.jpg)](/images/xfer/updates/ford/br20d.jpg) From the front view you can see the early Bronco Dana 20 does not use the Texas bolt pattern used by the Jeep Dana 20 on the left. The Bronco case is drivers drivers drop and uas a yoke on it for a CV joint.
