# Ford Transfer Cases

Our intention is not to cover Ford transfer cases in detail, but just provide some tips on what to look for in what trucks and only stuff that would be of interest to a Jeep owner.

Many Ford trucks use Borg-Warner transfer cases which are less desirable to a Jeeper than the New Process and Dana transfer cases. Borg-Warner transfer cases are not covered here.
