The Atlas transfer case is a new development from Advanced Adapters. It is gear driven with an aluminum case. The internals are similar to a Dana 300 except it has a low range reduction of 3.7:1 and lower. They have version for the Wrangler and should have versions for earlier CJs available at this time. ![Atlas with NP-231 front](../../../img/xfer/updates/atlaswnp231-front_.jpg) A front view of the Atlas transfer case and the NP231. ![Atlas with NP-231 drivers side](../../../img/xfer/updates/atlaswnp231-lside_.jpg) The Atlas and NP-231 transfer case from the drivers side. ![Atlas vs. NP-231 passenger side](../../../img/xfer/updates/atlaswnp231-rside_.jpg) The Atlas and NP-231 transfer case from the passenger side.
