# IH Dana 18

[![Scout 80 Dana 18](/img/xfer/d1801f_.jpg)](/img/xfer/d1801f.jpg) [![Scout 80 Dana 18](/img/xfer/d1801s_.jpg)](/img/xfer/d1801s.jpg) [![Scout 80 Dana 18](/img/xfer/d1801b_.jpg)](/img/xfer/d1801b.jpg) 

The Dana 18 transfer case used in IH Scout 80s in the early 60s is bolt compatible with the small hole Jeep Dana 18 transfer case. The Scout 80 version uses the larger 1 1/4" intermediate shaft, small hole, and 26 tooth drive gear.

The above pictures are really from a Scout 80 Spicer 18 although it is indistinguishable from Jeep Spicer 18s. A nice feature of this transfer case is it has a nice short rear tail housing and no emergency brake drum.

## Swaps
