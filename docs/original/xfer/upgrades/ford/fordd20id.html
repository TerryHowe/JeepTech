<p>
The Ford Dana 20 transfer case is gear driven with a cast iron case.
It was used in early Broncos from 1966 until 1977 and it was used in
some Ford pickups.  It is drivers drop and it was available with a
couple different low range ratios all around 2.4:1.</p>
<p>
The Ford Dana 20 looks a lot different than the Jeep Dana 20.  The
Jeep Dana 20 is passenger drop of course, but that isn't the only
difference.  Parts from the Ford Dana 20 can be used convert a Jeep
Dana 20 to have a better low range.  Two write ups on this conversion
are located at <a href="https://www.off-road.com/~jweed/transfer.html">

The rear view of the Jeep Dana 20 and the early Bronco Dana 20.
You can see the case is completely different.  The shift rails
are in different places.  The rear yoke has been removed from
the Bronco Dana 20.

From the front view you can see the early Bronco Dana 20 does not
use the Texas bolt pattern used by the Jeep Dana 20 on the left.
The Bronco case is drivers drivers drop and uas a yoke on it for
a CV joint.
