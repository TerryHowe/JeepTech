<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The CJ-2A was the first civilian Jeep. It was
produced from July 17th 1945 through 1949.
It looks similar to a M38, CJ-3A, or MB, but it has flush mounted
head lights and the wind shield is made with round tubing.  The
windshield is split were as the CJ-3A uses a one piece wind
shield (except for some export versions), is made with square tubing,
and is taller above the glass.  CJ-2A tubs are compatible with the M38,
CJ-3A, and MB tubs, but there are cosmetic differences.  All of them
used the "Go Devil" L head 134 I4 engine.

</p>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>Early versions of the CJ-2A (until 1946 serial number 38220) were
produced with a column shift T-90.  The later versions of the CJ-2A
were produced with "three on the floor" rather than "three on the
tree."  Some early CJ-2As also had the Spicer 23-2 rear end and shovel
and axe grooves on the drivers side like one would find on the MB.
Later CJ-2As had a Dana 41 rear end and no grooves on the drivers side.

<h3>Serial Number Locations</h3>
<p>Serial numbers are located on the out side of the left front frame
horn, behind the bumper.  An exception to this is the first 100 or so
1945s where the frame tag is on the inside frame horn reinforcement
like the MBs.</p>
<p>The engine number was located at the front of the
engine block on the water pump boss.</p>
