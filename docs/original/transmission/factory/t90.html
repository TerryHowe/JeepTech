<p>
The T-90 is a 3 speed transmission with
a casting number of T90 and a 1 1/8" 10
spline input shaft.  Length of input shaft varies with
application.  Output is 1 3/8" 6 spline.  The T-90s used
in 1945 and some of 1946 where column shift.  Later versions
were floor shift like in the picture.</p>

Drivers side view of T-90 with Chevy adapter.  This adapter is the
factory adapter that was used with the T-86 and Dauntless Buick
225 V6 engine.  Most likely, the transmission is a T-90 case that
has been rebuilt with T-86 internals.  Many parts interchange
between the transmissions.
