<p>
The T-18 is a heavy duty four speed with unsynchronized first
gear.  These transmissions were manufactured by Borg Warner
and they have a cast iron case.  The casting number on the drivers
side of the T-18 is T-18 or 13-01.  The T-18 has a 1 1/8" 10
spline input shaft and a 1 3/8" 6 spline output.</p>
<p>
The T-98 has a very similar appearance to the
T-18 except a casting number of T98.  It is heavy duty like the
T-18, but a bit more prone to wear since bearings and lubrication
are not as good.  Internals from a T-18 can be put in a T-98 case.
The side picture above is actually a T-98 with granny T-18 guts.
The T-98 has a 1 1/16" 10 spline input shaft and 1 3/8" 6 spline
output.</p>

T-18s used after 1978 have reverse down by fourth and earlier T-18s
have reverse up by third.  The shape of the case is also different
with the '79+ cases for the different reverse configuration.  On
the right is a T-18 out of a '79 CJ-5.  The blue T-18 in the picture
above is out of a '78 CJ-5.  Notice the later T-18 has a flat side
rather than the bulging side of the earlier T-18.  Both versions
have a PTO port on the drivers side.
</p>
<p>
The T-18s used in full size Jeeps(FSJs) such as the Chorokee, Wagoneer,
and J-series pickups use a transmission to bell housing adapter.
Three basic variations exist with different adapters.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Early 70s T-18s use a 1" cast iron adapter with a deep AMC bell
housing.  The bell housing is the same as the bell housing used
with the T-15.</li>
<li>
Later 70s FSJs with V8 engines use a 5" aluminum adapter and a
AMC T-15 bell housing.  There are pictures of this version
below.</li>
<li>
Later 70s FSJs with I6 engines use a shoter aluminum adapter and a
AMC T-15 bell housing.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The different adapter means a different length input shaft is used.
The input shaft size and spline count is consistent for all the Jeep
T-18s, but the pilot bushing size varies.  The different adapters
used with the later V8 and I6 engine where presumably used to keep
the drive shaft lengths consistent regardless of engine.</p>
<p>
All Jeep T-18s come with a 1" adapter for the Dana 20 transfer case
except the T-18 used in 1980 and 1981 J-20 pickups.  These trucks
used the NP208 transfer case and the adapter for the NP208 is around
9" long and it uses a round bolt pattern.  The output shaft of this
version of the T-18 is 23 spline.  The Dana 20 version of the T-18
has the big hole "Texas" bolt pattern and 6 spline output shaft.</p>

adapter removed.  The adapter length and input shaft length are
different depending on engine combination.  The adapter bolts to
a long AMC bell housing.

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
The T-18 was optional on CJs from 1971-1979.  The T-18A
version used from 1977-1979 is the best transmission ever
put in a CJ by the factory since it features a granny low first
gear(6:32:1.)  Earlier T-18s have the same great strength, but a
4.03:1 first.  The T-98 is the predecessor to the T-18 that was
an option for CJs from 1955-1970.</p>
<p>
Other Jeep trucks also had the T-98 as an option from 1955-1970,
the close ratio T-18 optional from 1971-1975, and the wide ratio
T-18 from 1976-1979.  After 1979, the wide ratio T-18 was only
available as an option in the J-20 pickup truck from 1980-1981.
This version of the T-18 has the round New Process bolt pattern
and 23 spline output, but the adapter is long for a short wheel base
Jeep.  Earlier T-18s and T-98s used the "Texas" bolt pattern and
6 spline output.  The truck version of the T-18 uses a long input
shaft compared to the T-98 or CJ T-18s.</p>
