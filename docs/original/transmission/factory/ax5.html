<p>
The AX-5 is a light duty five speed transmission.  It looks similar
to the AX-15, but smaller.  It is manufactured by Aisin in Japan.
The input shaft is 1" 14 spline and the output shaft can be 21
spline or 23 spline.

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
The AX-5 and the Peugeot BA 10/5 were used in all Wranglers from
1987-1989.  After mid 1989, the AX-5 has only been used in 4 cylinder
Wranglers (YJs and TJs).  Its usage is similar in Cherokees (XJ)
and Comanches (MJ).</p>

A driver's side shot of a BA 10/5 for comparison.  Notice how the
<a href="/transmission/factory/ba10.html">BA 10/5</a>
doesn't have the regular ribbing on the driver's side.  The
passenger side of the BA 10/5 does have regular ribbing.  The main case
of the BA 10/5 is made of two pieces bolted together, where as the
AX-5 main case is one solid piece of cast aluminum.
