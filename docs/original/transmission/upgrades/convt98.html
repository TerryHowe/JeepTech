<p>
The T-98 is the oldest of Borg-Warner's
large production, granny unsynchronized first, heavy duty, four speeds.
It was used in Jeep, Ford, and IH trucks.
The input bearing retainer size (4.85") and often the input
shaft length is compatible with the bell housing used with the
T-150, T-176, T-5, T-4, SR-4, and of course Jeep T-18.
</p>
<p>
On the Jeep version, the input shaft length varies depending
on the application, but the shaft can be cut and resplined or
an input shaft of the appropriate length can  be installed.
The Ford version of the T-98 uses a larger diameter input shaft,
so a clutch disk that matches the larger input shaft must be used.
If you are planning on converting a transmission,
a 2WD Ford T-18 would probably be easier to find and install.</p>
