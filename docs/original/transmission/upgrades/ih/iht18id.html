<p>
The T-18s was used in International Havevester trucks from the mid
60s until the mid 70s.  They all tend to  have long input shafts
compared to the Jeep and Ford T-18s.  All the T-18s used in the
Scout 800 and Scout II are close ratio T-18s with a first gear around
4:1.  It is an excellent transmission, but it doesn't have the low
first off-roaders want.  Other IH trucks do use wide ratio T-18s.</p>
<p>
An advantage of the IH 4WD T-18s is most of them were mated with
the Dana 20 transfer case.  The Dana 20 used in Scout trucks uses
the same bolt pattern and input gear as most of the Dana 20s used
in Jeep trucks.  The transmission to transfer case adapter for the
Dana 20 used in IH trucks is short like the adapter used in Jeep
trucks.  Rebuilding one of these transmissions with a Ford or Jeep
input shaft may be a way of getting a low buck T-18 in your Jeep.</p>
<p>
Like the versions of the T-18 used in other makes of trucks, IH
T-18s have a casting number of 13-01 or T-18 on the drivers side.
All IH T-18s have reverse out and up.</p>
