Rain...that is what it managed to do most of the way over to Holy Cross
for Paul, Cindy, Jake and Lydia...when they arrived they found Robin.
Dave, Buffy, Cari, Curtis and his dad Harry, Doug and Justin.  Ray,
Leah, Rose and Nathan joined us later that night...next morning dawned
cool with a bit of a cloud cover that soon burned off as we trekked up
the Holy Cross Road.

For most of the trip up we had no problems when we reached the tree
we were joined by Terry and Sean who had managed to catch up with
us...Sean now has his rig up and running but managed to get a ding in
the door at the tree.  Most of us didn't have too many problems until
Frenchman creek and there is was really just a more interesting crossing
now.
</p>
<p>
But just before the old mud bog we did find a spot that caused some
concern and some decided to use the mud way instead of over the
rocks...we did have one very adventurous person who dared the rocks and
was very close to being a bit too high, but backed down and made it
through all right.
</p>
<p>
When we got to the city some of us choose to stay behind while the more
adventurous continued up to the lake...Jake had some problems and Dave
managed to break an axle again...Jake sounded liked he had a monster
truck on the way back.  Those of us back at the city could hear the
others calling out directions which sometimes caused us to wonder what
was going on...Rosie kept herself busy by making mud pies, Nathan
managed to attract the mosquitoes both of them had fun watching the
chipmunk who would steal up to the back of the bronco and take the food
that had fallen during lunch.
</p>
<p>
After a fun filled afternoon we headed back to have Paul run into
trouble on Frenchman and had to be winched off the rocks, ran into some
other 4 wheelers who were headed up to the city...one was not too happy
about the delay, waiting for all of us to come down.  the only other
problem was a flat tire.

Sunday found Paul, Jake, Lydia, Doug, Justin and Ray headed for Yoder
Gulch...Dave stayed behind to ready the trailer for an early start
home.  Leah, Rosie and Nathan decided to go for a walk to the river. 
Cindy stayed in camp working on some crafts.  
</p>
<p>
Yoder Gulch was a short trip from the mountain top directly east of 
the camp site, to a conclusion at Camp Hale.  Although it was not a very
technically challenging trip the drive meandered its way down the creek
next to beaver dams and beautiful green meadows.  There were a few mud
bogs and side hills to make things interesting, but otherwise it was a
beautiful drive.  After leaving the creek bottom the road became an
easy shelf road traveling through a long aspen grove and then opening up
into a open field directly above Camp Hale.  The last 15 to 20 feet of
the trail was almost straight up and down ending next to the railroad
tracks.  the highway and back to camp.
Total trip time was about 3 hours making it a nice get-away-day  trip.
