<p>
Roger Wild, John Heskett with friend Kevin, Steve Smith, and I
all arrived at the trail head around 10:30 Friday night.
It was a cool evening with partly cloudy skies.  We quickly
set up camp and made a fire to keep warm.  The weather forecast
was for Saturday called for a chance of snow even though
it didn't look like snow.  We hit our sleeping bags fairly early
to get rested for some serious four wheeling the next day.</p>
<p>

We woke up late in the morning to the soft sound of snow hitting our
tents.  The snow wasn't heavy when we got up, but it was coming down
at a good rate.  There wasn't any sense in waiting it out, so we aired
down and hit the trail.</p>
<p>
Because of the snow we stayed on the road as long as we could rather
than dropping right into the creek.  Shortly before the big cave
we ran out of road and started hitting the trail.  The snow had
changed to big heavy flakes by this time and it was coming down hard.
The traction wasn't too bad considering the weather and we soon made
the big cave.</p>
<p>
The cave protected the squeeze rock, so we all gave it a try since it
might be the only dry obstacle of the day.  It wasn't too dry since
you had to drive through running water to get to it, but we all made
it.  Not that we all had clean runs, but we made it.  I set the
pace by putting a large dent in my front fender.  John managed to
hit his nerf bar into his rocker a bit here as well.</p>
<p>

After the squeeze we continued on skipping a lot of optional obstacles
in the hope that we would be able to complete the trail.   It wasn't
long before we hit Carnage Corner.  Getting through Carnage Corner took
a while, but we all made it through without body damage or throwing
a cable.</p>
<p>
Soon after Carnage Corner, I decided to try an absurdly difficult
obstacle.  I was surprised that I was actually able to get on it,
but I could not get my Jeep over it.  Not sure if my Jeep would
do that one on a good day.</p>
<p>
After Carnage Corner, it is just one obstacle after another and with
all the snow on the ground it was kind of hard to see the texture of
the trail.  By this time the snow had tapered off a bit and our
<a href="../../img/terry/trail/tr981201.jpg"><img src="../../img/terry/trail/tr981201_.jpg" alt="Terry on an optional rock"></a>
confidence had increased.  Everyone was trying different lines on
things some harder some easier.  Easier on this part of the trail
with snow on it is relative.</p>
<p>
Roger found a neat obstacle that was particularly protected by an
over hanging cliff and managed to max out his Lev-o-Gauge.
I tried some real dumb line in this area and I had to throw a
cable.  While winching there was a loud bang and I stopped and
got out to find out what broke.  All my front u-joints looked
fine and I was about to hop back in until someone noticed my
front hub was in several pieces.  After replacing my hub and
some work with the Hi-Lift, I was free.</p>
<p>
We continued on managed to complete the trail just as the sun was
dropping below the horizon.  When we finally got back to camp,
John and Kevin packed and headed home while Roger, Steve, and
I made a large fire.  We were all thankful we escaped with no
major damage.  The night turned cold, but we slept well after
a long day of using the Hi-Lift and winch.</p>
