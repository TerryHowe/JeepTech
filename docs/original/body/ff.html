<p>
Giving your Wrangler, CJ-7, or CJ-5 the flat fender look not only looks cool, it increases tire clearance.  Many of round fender Jeeps you'll find on the hard trails have adopted this look for increased tire clearance, tighter turning radius, and longer fender life.
</p>

<p>
If you plan to drive your Jeep on the street, check your local laws
to make sure that bobbing the bumper and removing the side marker
lights will not make your Jeep illegal.  The side marker lights
can be moved up to the side of the hood if they are necessary
to stay street legal.
</p>

<h3>Cutting The Fenders</h3>
<p>
<a href="../img/body/ff1.gif"><img src="../img/body/ff1_.gif"></a>
If you are going to remove your side marker lights and keep your
fender flares, you'll need to leave enough material on the fender
to attach the fender flare.  The top of the fender flare should be
lined up with the top of the fender, which for most fender flares,
will mean you'll be removing about 3/4" of material all around the
edge.  </p>
<p>

Before you start cutting anything, remove the side marker
lights and secure the wires out of the way.  Next,
put down a layer or three of masking tape over the area you plan
to cut to protect the paint and to make it easier to draw a line.</p>
<p>
The front of the fender will require some imagination and what
you cut will depend on personal taste.  To get a true flat fender
look, you'll need to remove most of the round front part of the
fender.  You may want to scribe a guideline along the front grill
since it will be challenging to see what you are cutting when you are
cutting along the grill.  Mark out both sides so you get an even
look.</p>
<p>

Once you have the lines
drawn, use a saber saw with a 24 tooth per inch blade or similar tool to
remove the material.  This should leave a very clean cut that only
needs some filing to remove burrs and some touch up paint.</p>
<p>
After everything is cut and painted, you'll want to remount your
fender flares.  Before you mount them, you'll need to trim them down
using a utility knife with a sharp, new blade.  Trim them to the new
lines of your fenders and try not to cut your finger.</p>

<h3>Chopping the Bumper</h3>
<p>
There's a trail in Colorado called Mine Sweeper that is a test
of bumper length.  The first obstacle is called "Winch and Go"
because almost no one makes it.  Those that make it have a short
bumper because it is a large stone step, and once you crest it,
you have to make a sharp right.  If your bumper is too long,
you won't be able to make a sharp enough right, and you'll be
stuck on the crest or bounce back down.  If you've been to Moab,
it is like Bump Dump on Hell's Revenge with a turn at the top.</p>
<p>
Again, you might want to check local laws before chopping your bumper.
You can cut your bumper really short like Mark did, or you can leave
some.  The easy way to tell the maximum amount of bumper to leave is by
turning the wheel to the stop and taking a straight edge along the
outside edge of the tire.  Chop the bumper along this plane.  A
circular hand saw with a metal cutting blade works great for this.
Wearing safety goggles when you cut will prevent the red-hot metal
particles from entering your eyes.</p>
