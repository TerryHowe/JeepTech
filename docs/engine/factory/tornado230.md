# Jeep Engine: Tornado 230 I6

The "Tornado" 230 I6 uses a cast iron block and cylinder head with over head valves. The 230 was a bit ahead of its time because it used an overhead cam. The engine gets a bad reputation because of it's complexity compared to other engines at the time. The 230 is the only Kaiser engine to be used in a Jeep in all the years they owned Jeep.

The Tornado was used in Willys Pickups, Willys Wagons, J-series pickups, Wagoneers, M715s, and M725s.

The 230 was used in Jeep pickups (Gladiator) from 1963 until 1964. It was also used in Willys Pickups and Willys Wagons from '63 until '65.
