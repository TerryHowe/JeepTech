# Jeep Engine: AMC 150 I4

The 2.5L inline 4 (I4) engine used in Jeeps today was first introduced in '84 when Jeep was owned by AMC. Originally, the engine used a carburetor, later versions used throttle body fuel injection, and the current version uses multi-port fuel injection. The fuel induction has been the major change with this engine over the years. The 2.5L uses over head valves with hydraulic lifters and a cast iron block and cylinder head.

The current version of the 2.5L I4 engine uses multi-port fuel injection. This engine is the standard engine used in the Wrangler (TJ) and Cherokee (XJ). It was the standard engine in the Wrangler (YJ) since 1991. The XJ version of the 2.5L has a slightly higher output.
