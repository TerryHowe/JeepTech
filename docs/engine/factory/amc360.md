# AMC 360 V8

[![360 V8](../../img/engine/360_.jpg)](../../img/engine/360.jpg)

The AMC 360 was introduced in 1971 in J-series pickups and Wagoneers. It has a cast iron block and cylinder head with over head valves and hydraulic lifters.

In 1971, the AMC 360 have very high rating. I would assume these are gross ratings and the later are net ratings.

| Attribute           | Specification |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Bore x Stroke       | 4.08" x 3.44" |
| Displacement        | 360(5.89L)    |
| Compression Ratio   | 8.5:1         |
| Horsepower (gross)  | 245@4400      |
| Torque (gross)      | 365@2600      |
| Main Bearings       | 5             |
| Valve Configuration | OHV           |
| Fuel                | 2bbl          |

In 1972, the 2bbl 360 is more conservatively rated, presumably these are net ratings.

| Valve Configuration | OHV           |
| Fuel                | 2bbl          |

In 1973, an optional 4bbl carburetor was available. The horsepower and torque ratings for this version are significantly better.
