# Jeep Engine: Go Devil 134

The power and torque of the L-Head engine is arguably the main reason Willys won the contract with the DOD to produce the MB used in WWII. It doesn't seem like much by today's standards, but it out performed the engines used in the Ford and Bantam prototypes. The MB used a different carburetor from the civilian models and currently I do not have the precise specs on it, but it is right in this same range.

The L-Head is known as the L-Head because the valves for the exhaust and intake are in the block. Most engines used in automobiles today have valves in the head. This design gave it the advantage of having a relatively low profile. Part of the DOD specifications required the vehicle to be able to drive under an object that was about 3 feet high.

The L-Head engines uses a cast iron block and cylinder head with 3 main bearings and mechanical lifters. The "Go Devil" engine earned its fame in the MB use in WWII. The L-Head continued to be used in the post war CJ-2A, Willys Wagon, Willys Pickup, CJ-3A, M38, and DJ-3A. The specifications are slightly different presumably due to carburetor and compression differences between the engines. The L-Head used in '45-'50 CJ-2As and '49-'50 CJ-3As is rated the same.

| Attribute | Specification |

| Fuel | Carter WO-596S 1bbl downdraft |

The L-Head used in 1947 until mid 1950 Willys Pickups and Willys Wagons has a slightly higher torque rating. It uses a different carburetor and has different compression.

A high altitude version of the L-Head was optional with the Willys Pickup and Willys Wagon.
