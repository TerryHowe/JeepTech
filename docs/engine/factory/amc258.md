# Jeep Engine: AMC 258 I6

[![258 I6](../../img/engine/258_.jpg)](../../img/engine/258.jpg) 

The AMC 258 was introduced in 1971 in J-series pickups and Wagoneers and in 1972 in CJs. It continued to be used through 1990 in the Wrangler. It is basically a stroked 232 engine. The great thing about this engine is it reliable, inexpensive, and has horse power and toque peaks at low RPM.

The 258 inline 6 (I6) engine always came from the factory carbureted any many people complain about the Carter BBD carburetor and the maze of emissions vacuum hoses. There are a couple articles below that can help you sort through those hoses and tune the Carter BBD. For a carbureted engine, the 258 with the Carter BBD performs very well off road. The 258 always came with a cast iron block and cylinder head, hydraulic lifters (with non-adjustable rockers), and 7 main bearings.

The 258 used in '87-'90 Wrangler YJs uses a computer controlled Carter BBD. It is very similar to the 258 used in '82-'86 CJs, but performance suffers due to emission controls.
