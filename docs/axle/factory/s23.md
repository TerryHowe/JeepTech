# Jeep Axle: Spicer 23-2

| The MB and the CJ-2A (until serial number #13453 in early '46) used the Spicer 23-2. I'm not sure on the entire company history, but Spicer later became part of what is now known as the Dana Corporation. This axle is the only full floating axle ever used in a CJ from the factory, but it is not known for its strength. In fact, they are hard to find in working order.
