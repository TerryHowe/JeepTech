# Jeep Axle: Dana 27

The Dana 27 uses a 7 1/5" ring and pinion that is only available in 3.54:1, 3.73:1, 4.27:1, 4.88:1, and 5.38:1 ratios in the CJs. It was also available in a 4.10:1 ratio in other Jeeps. Many parts of the Dana 27 interchange with the Dana 25. The Dana 27 normally came with the superior Cardan-Cross u-joint type axle shafts, but carrier bearing and ring and pinion are smaller than the Dana 25.

### Specs

The CJ models that used the Dana 27 include the CJ-5, CJ-5A, CJ-6, and CJ-6A. I have heard rumors that M38A1s were always built with the Dana 25, but I have not been able to confirm this.
