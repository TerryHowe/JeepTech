# Jeep Axle: Dana 41

[![Dana 41 diff cover](/images/axle/bwd41_.jpg)](/images/axle/bwd41.jpg)   

The Dana 41-2 was used in the CJ-2A after serial number #13453 in early '46, and it was used in the CJ-3A until serial number #37549 (late '50). Looking at the diff cover, it appears as tall as a Dana 44, but not as wide. It was also used in Willys Wagons and Jeepster VJs during this time period.
