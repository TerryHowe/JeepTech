[MA/MB/GPW](/models/mb.md) The military is where the Jeep began and the lineage of the Jeep can even be traced to military vehicles today. The first production military Jeep was the MB of World War II fame. It's success in the military is still part of the mystic of civilian Jeeps today. There have been various Jeeps used by the US and foreign militaries over the years and even the lineage of the Hummer can be traced back to the Jeep. The Hummer is developed and produced by AM General which split off from AMC shortly after AMC purchased Jeep from Kaiser in the early 70s. ![M170](/toc/m170s_.jpg)[ M170 ](/models/m170.md): Pictures of probably one of the rarest Jeep models ever built, the M170. The M170 is a stretched M38A1 similar to a CJ-6 and very few were ever built.
