# CJ-8

The CJ-8/Scrambler was produced from 1981 until 1985. It is hardly a "short" Jeep, but it shares many of the characteristics of the CJ-7s and late CJ-5s.

## Drive Train

### Engine

In 1981, the CJ-8 was offered stock with the GM [151 I4](../engine/factory/gm151.md) engine, and the [258](../engine/factory/amc258.md) I6 and [304](../engine/factory/amc304.md) V8 were optional. The last year for the 304 was 1981. The GM 151 was replaced with AMC [150](../engine/factory/amc150.md) I4 in 1984.

### Transmission

The [SR-4](../transmission/factory/t4.md) and [T-176](../transmission/factory/t176.md) were used with the I4 and I6. The [T-176](../transmission/factory/t176.md) was used with the 304. After 1981, the [T-4](../transmission/factory/t4.md), [T-176](../transmission/factory/t176.md), and [T-5](../transmission/factory/t5.md) 5 speed were used. The TF999 was used with the I6 and V8, and the TF904 was used with the I4.

### Transfer Case

The [Dana 300](../xfer/factory/d300.md) was the transfer case used in the CJ-8.

### Front Axle

The [Dana 30](../axle/factory/d30.md) was always used in the CJ-8.

### Rear Axle

The CJ-8 used the [AMC 20](../axle/factory/amc20.md) rear axle.
