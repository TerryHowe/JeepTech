## Drive Train

### Engine

The Jeepster/Commando was originally offered with the ["Hurricane" F-Head 134 I4](/engine/factory/hurricane134.html). The ["Dauntless" Buick 225 V6](/engine/factory/dauntless225.html) was an optional engine in the late 60s. When AMC purchased Jeep from Kaiser, they soon made the AMC [232](/engine/factory/amc232.html), [258](/engine/factory/amc258.html), and [304](/engine/factory/amc304.html) available in the Commando C104 in 1972 and 1973.

### Transmission

The [T-90](/transmission/factory/t90.html) 3 speed was the standard transmission for the Jeepster with the F-Head engine and it's close brother, the [T-86](/transmission/factory/t86.html) 3 speed was used with the Dauntless V6. The [T-14](/transmission/factory/t14.html) replaced the T-86 with the 6 cylinder engines and later the beefy [T-15](/transmission/factory/t15.html) was used with CJ-5 with the 304. The [TH400](/transmission/factory/th400.html) was the optional automatic available for the Commando only with the Buick and AMC engines.
