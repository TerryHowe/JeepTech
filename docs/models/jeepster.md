The Jeepster/Commando (C101) was produced from 1962 until 1971 and the Commando (C104) was produced from 1972 until 1973.

## Drive Train

### Engine

The Jeepster/Commando was originally offered with the ["Hurricane" F-Head 134 I4](../engine/factory/hurricane134.md). The ["Dauntless" Buick 225 V6](../engine/factory/dauntless225.md) was an optional engine in the late 60s. When AMC purchased Jeep from Kaiser, they soon made the AMC [232](../engine/factory/amc232.md), [258](../engine/factory/amc258.md), and [304](../engine/factory/amc304.md) available in the Commando C104 in 1972 and 1973.

### Transmission

The [T-90](../transmission/factory/t90.md) 3 speed was the standard transmission for the Jeepster with the F-Head engine and it's close brother, the [T-86](../transmission/factory/t86.md) 3 speed was used with the Dauntless V6. The [T-14](../transmission/factory/t14.md) replaced the T-86 with the 6 cylinder engines and later the beefy [T-15](../transmission/factory/t15.md) was used with CJ-5 with the 304. The [TH400](../transmission/factory/th400.md) was the optional automatic available for the Commando only with the Buick and AMC engines.

### Transfer Case

The Jeepster/Commando was only available with the [Dana 20](../xfer/factory/d20.md) transfer case.
