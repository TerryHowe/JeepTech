# Postal/Dispatch Jeep (DJ)

The Postal/Dispatch Jeep was made in two basic models, the DJ-3A and the DJ-5. The DJ-3A was a flat fender postal Jeep similar to the CJ-3A except it was two wheel drive. It was produced from 1956 until 1965. The DJ-5 was introduced in 1965 which is the postal Jeep most people are familiar with today. They also produced a long version from 1965 until 1968, the DJ-6. The DJ-5 was made by Jeep into the early 70s and production continued under AM General.
