## Drive Train

### Engine

The original engine offered in the CJ-6 was the ["Hurricane" F-Head 134 I4](/engine/factory/hurricane134.md). The first optional engine offered for the CJ-6 was the [Perkins 192 I4](/engine/factory/perkins192.md) diesel followed by the ["Dauntless" Buick 225 V6](/engine/factory/dauntless225.md). When AMC purchased Jeep from Kaiser, they soon made the AMC [232](/engine/factory/amc232.md), [258](/engine/factory/amc258.md), and [304](/engine/factory/amc304.md) available in the CJ-6.

### Transmission

The [T-90](/transmission/factory/t90.md) 3 speed was the standard transmission for the CJ-6 for many years. It's close brother, the [T-86](/transmission/factory/t86.md) 3 speed was used with CJ-6s with the Dauntless V6. The [T-14](/transmission/factory/t14.md) replaced the T-90 and later the beefy [T-15](/transmission/factory/t15.md) was used with CJ-6 with the 304. The [ T-98](/transmission/factory/t18.md) was an optional 4 speed for the CJ-6 until 1971 when the [T-18](/transmission/factory/t18.md) became the optional 4 speed. 

### Transfer Case

The CJ-6 used the [Dana 18](/xfer/factory/d18.md) from '58 until '71. From '72-'75 they used the [Dana 20](/xfer/factory/d20.md). 

### Front Axle

The CJ-6 was first offered with the [Dana 25](/axle/factory/d25.md) until 1965. The [Dana 27](/axle/factory/d27.md) replaced it and was used until 1971. From 1972-1975, the [Dana 30](/axle/factory/d30.md) was used in the CJ-6. 

### Rear Axle

The [Dana 44](/axle/factory/d44.md) with two piece shafts was used in the CJ-6 until mid-1970. A [Dana 44](/axle/factory/d44.md) with one piece shafts replaced it after that.
