General information about transmissions.

## The Purpose of a Transmission

Your Jeep’s engine only runs well within a certain RPM (revolutions per minute) range.

The transmission lets the engine stay in that range while still allowing the car to go from a crawl to highway speeds.

Gears multiply torque at low speeds (to get moving) and reduce it at high speeds (to cruise efficiently).

## Main Parts

Clutch: A friction disc that connects or disconnects the engine from the transmission.

Gear Set: A series of different-sized gears that provide different ratios.

Shift Forks & Synchronizers: Help smoothly engage gears without grinding.

Gear Stick (Shifter): The lever the driver moves to select gears.

## How It Works

Clutch pedal pressed → separates engine from transmission, so gears can change without damage.

Select a gear with the shifter → moves a shift fork inside the transmission, sliding a collar (synchronizer) that locks a gear onto the output shaft.

Synchronizers match the speed of the gear to the shaft so they mesh smoothly.

Clutch pedal released → reconnects engine to transmission through the chosen gear.

Car moves → engine torque goes through the chosen gear ratio, to the driveshaft, then wheels.

## Why they work

1st gear: Big gear ratio → more torque, less speed (good for starting).

Higher gears: Smaller gear ratios → less torque, more speed (good for cruising).

Reverse gear: Uses an extra idler gear to spin wheels backwards.

## Why People Like Manual Transmissions

More control (especially for performance or off-road driving).

Usually simpler and cheaper to repair.

Engaging to drive for people who enjoy the mechanical feel.
