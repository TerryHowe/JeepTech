# Jeep Transmissions: T-15

[![T-15 front](../../img/transmission/factory/t15f_.jpg)](../../img/transmission/factory/t15f.jpg) [![T-15 side](../../img/transmission/factory/t15ds_.jpg)](../../img/transmission/factory/t15ds.jpg) [![T-15 back](../../img/transmission/factory/t15b_.jpg)](../../img/transmission/factory/t15b.jpg)   

The T-15 is a 3 speed transmission with a cast iron case. I has a casting number of T15 or 1307 and a 1 1/8" 10 spline input shaft. The T-15 has a 1 3/8" 6 spline output shaft. It has a reputation as the strongest of the 3 speeds.

[![T-15 passenger side](../../img/transmission/factory/t15ps_.jpg)](../../img/transmission/factory/t15ps.jpg) The casting numbers on the T-15 are on the passenger side near the top back. [![T-15 vs. T-90](../../img/transmission/factory/t15t90_.jpg)](../../img/transmission/factory/t15t90.jpg) Here's a top view of a T-90 and a T-15. The T-90 has an adapter on the front for the Dauntless V6, the adapter was probably originally on a T-86. The front of each transmission is even to show how much longer the T-15 is compared to the T-90. 

### Usage

The T-15 was used only in V8 equipped CJs and Jeep trucks from 1972 to 1975.
