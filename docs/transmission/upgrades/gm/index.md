# GM Transmissions

The low cost and high availability of GM transmissions makes them excellent fodder for a swap into a Jeep truck. A GM transmission makes more sense if your Jeep truck already has a GM engine or if you plan to swap in a GM engine. In the late 60s and early 70s, Jeep pickups and Wagoneers used the Buick 350 engine and the CJs used the Buick 225. If a transmission swap is planned for these vehicles, a GM transmission is the best bet.
