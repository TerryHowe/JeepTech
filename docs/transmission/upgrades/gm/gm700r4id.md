# GM 700R4

The 700R4 is a strong 4 speed automatic transmission use from 1982 until 1990 in GM trucks. Early units where know for failure and so this transmission doesn't have the best reputation, but a well built 700R4 will preform very well off-road. The case is 23 1/2 inches long and 16 bolts hold on the pan. The 700R4 has been replaced by the electronically controlled 4L80E.
