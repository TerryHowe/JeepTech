# Jeep Transmissions Conversions: SM420

[![Transfer case adapter, transmission, bell housing](../../../img/transmission/updates/sm420yj/trans20_.jpg)](../../../img/transmission/updates/sm420yj/trans20.jpg) 

The SM420 is the old Chevy heavy duty granny four speed. Of all the heavy duty granny transmissions, it has the lowest first gear and a particularly short overall length (the Jeep T-18 is the shortest when you add transmission to transfer case adapter.) Another big adantage of this transmission is it's input bearing retainer size and input shaft length is compatible with most GM engines. The only downside to the SM420 is it has been out of production so long, parts have become scarce. Most of the standard wear items like synchros and bearings are still available though and spare transmissions can be purchased cheaply for other parts.

The SM420 was only used in 2WD applications and 4WD applications with divorce mounted transfer cases. Unless you plan on using a divorce mounted transfer case, you will need an adapter regardless of what transfer case you have.
