# Bicycling

![Bike](/img/terry/bike/dt19.jpg)

Bicycling has been my primary hobby more than any other hobby. Lately biking has taken a bit of a back burner, I've barely ridden this year. It is hard to find time to play hockey two nights a week and keep the Jeep running _and_ ride. Part of the problem, is most of the decent parks in the area have been recently closed to Mt. biking. 

I'm due for a bit of a biking break anyway, since last summer I spent two straight months on my bike. I have started on a trip report of my [odyssey](odyssey.md) across the United Sates with Diane in the summer of 1994. 

Right now I have two Trek 970s. One is set up for off-road with Specialized suspension fork and big nobbies. The other is set up for touring with road slicks, bike rack, and lots of water bottle cages.
