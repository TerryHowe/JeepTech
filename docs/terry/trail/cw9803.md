by Jacob and Heather McGhee  

![Terry on China Wall](../../img/terry/trail/cw980301.jpg) Just as the sun was beginning to warm the gorgeous Colorado sky, a group of fearless four wheelers met in the Red Rocks parking lot at 9:00 am. One could but look into this lot and see Terry Howe, Dave Vest, Buffy the Dog, and Paul and Cindy Beaudean amid the sparkling amber day. Being the extraordinarily gifted leader he is, Jacob McGhee did indeed pick a wonderful day on which to challenge the Great China Wall.

This adventurous group met their first obstacle - glistening patch of snow, a frosty barrier between themselves and their alpine destiny. Recognizing it for what it was, their dashing leader defiantly winched through the snow, revealing a clear passage to his faithful followers. having defeated the opposing frost, the lively group climbed their second obstacle - an unrelenting mass of murky rock. After this most excruciating trial, Dave, a.k.a. the Courageous Mud Dancer, conversed with Tess and Troy. Apparently, the daring duo had failed to meet the group due to navigational errors. Forgetting this embarrassing faux pas, a rendezvous point was quickly set. With his team now united, Jacob the Bold led his group to an amazing stream that Tess and Troy had already graced with their presence. At this point, everyone forsook the cares of this treacherous world, opting to revel in the unpretentious beauty of nature.

They fearlessly fought the mud and snow, coming forth as victors once more. Although Tess and Troy encountered minor difficulties when coming up the hill, their trouble paled in comparison to the immense knowledge that comes with adversity. They recalled the famed words, "That which does not destroy us, makes us stronger." It was then they were met with fellow travelers in a pick up truck who were deciding whether or not to risk life and limb for the opportunity to see nature at its wettest. In such a forthright manner, Jacob declared, "Fear not, my stock driving friends! For you've enough people to help push if you find yourselves stuck!" This encouragement was all they needed, and the small group continued toward the stream.

On their way back from the imperious mountain, Paul, a.k.a. the Impeccable Hawkeye, dared Jacob the Bold to proceed up an unmerciful looking snow bank. Laughing, this confident leader accepted the challenge and emerged unscathed.

As the sunlight kissed the horizon once more, the spirited group of four wheelers returned to their homes, having once again conquered the good earth.
