# Trail Report: Rock Hoppers: Moab

### Hell's Revenge

We got into Moab about noon Friday and went over to do bits of Hell's Revenge. We hit Bump Dump and Bill set the tempo by blowing a hub on the obstacle. He headed into town to find a new one and we continued on, Matt was the only one to make Bump Dump in his open front and rear Defender 90. After being lost a couple times, we headed up the back side of Lion's Back. Dave and I were the only two, fool enough to take the stone step at the edge of the canyon. It was a piece of cake actually, but quite a head trip if you know the stories.

This is a shot that Diane took going down Lion's Back. The little dot at the bottom is a Jeep.

### Poison Spider Mesa

The next day we headed up Poison Spider Mesa. Here's a shot of Dave catching some air on Poison Spider.

### Golden Spike

After Poison Spider, we started down Golden Spike. We didn't get too far before Bill's A-arm fell apart and his axle basically fell off. He took off the A-arm and it looked like it had been cracked for a while and just decided to give out. Matt and Bill jumped in the Defender and headed for town to get the A-arm welded up. We continued on and Bob showed us how to do Golden Crack.

I followed, it wasn't bad. We continued on and Len, in his TJ, broke his rear drive shaft. We patched it together, only to have it fall off two more times before we just removed it and he continued in front wheel drive. We stopped at Double Whammy to watch some guys from Salt Lake City break parts. Bill and Matt passed us on the way back with a repaired A-arm. We got out around 8:30 and it wasn't until 11:30 when the rest of the gang finally got off the trail. A long fun day.
