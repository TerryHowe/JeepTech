# Trail Report: Big Horn:Las Cruces

![Pat's Bronco](../../img/terry/trail/lc971.jpg)

Pat gets major air driving over the Pickle Barrel on the Broad Canyon Trail. After the strap was applied to prevent rollover, he continued through the obstacle. ![Ray's Bronco](../../img/terry/trail/lc972.jpg)

Ray driving over one of the stone steps on the Wolf Run. Wayne Bennett (aka Flatlander) covered our trip through [Wolf Run](https://www.4X4NOW.com/nmlc7c.md) on his [4x4NOW web page](https://www.4X4NOW.com/). He included pictures of three Big Horn 4x4 club members: Ray Bork (Blue EB), Dave Vest (Green EB), and Chris Long (Blue YJ), but none of me. He also covered our run in Alamagordo, [The Gauntlet](https://www.4X4NOW.com/trnmg.md).
