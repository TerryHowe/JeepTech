# Trail Report: Hackett Gulch

![Terry's CJ-7 on Hackett Gulch](../../img/terry/trail/hack1.jpg)

Eric Resko was kind enough to take this shot of me catching some big air on Hackett Gulch. After the picture Eric was kind enough to strap me over this rock. I've done this obstacle a couple times in the past, but this was the first time I'd done it with 30 lbs of pressure in my tires. It's a lot easier with 12 lbs or so.

From behind you can see Diane in the passenger seat wondering why she decided to come out with me on this trail. 

This was the second time Eric and I ran Hackett this summer. The last time Eric broke the yoke on his rear axle and threw his drive shaft. He escaped with no damage on this trip.
