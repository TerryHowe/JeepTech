# Wheeler Lake 7/98

July 19, 1998  
by Dave Vest (Mud Dancer)  

Since Jacob was unable to lead his trip to Wheeler, I volunteered to lead in his place. I, Curtis, Paul, Brian, and Joe (a guest driving a Toyota 4Runner) departed Red Rocks at 8:04 a.m. and headed for Fairplay. Upon arrival in Fairplay, we gassed up and met Ray, Lea, and kids. We then headed towards Hooser pass and the trail head. We met (Terry and Diane) and (Bill and Krista) at the trail head. We aired down, dialed in, and headed up the trail.

At the first obstacle Bill decided to try and replant a downed tree with his truck. The tree refused and kept a marker light and CB antenna for a momento. A little while later, Brian (another guest, driving an orange Land Rover) joined us. The rest of the trip up to the lake was uneventful.

At the lake we met Jerry and Julie from Predator, visiting with them while we ate lunch. Apparently someone left their female Husky at the lake and Jerry and Julie took care of it over night while they were camped there. It had an ID tag on its collar so the owners were contacted and Bill and Krista were kind enough to meet them in Denver to facilitate its return. The trip home was also uneventful. As far as I know, a good time was had by all and no one missed the heat at home.
