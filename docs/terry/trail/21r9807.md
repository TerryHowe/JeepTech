Five vehicles departed camp for the trek up Road 21. Dave with Troy lead the way followed by Ray with Bob, Paul and Cindy, Jacob with Tess, and Terry and Diane. 

![Battlement Mesa](/images/terry/trail/tr079803.jpg) As advertised, the road was paved, then turned to gravel, and finally to dirt. We arrived at the first turn into the creek bed where we aired down and dialed in. After dropping into the creek bed, the fun began with obstacle after obstacle ranging form easy to hard. Everyone did well, with some choosing the easier lines and others the hardest they could find. We stopped for lunch in the shade of an overhang not knowing how far it was to the infamous "CAVE". After lunch, on one of the obstacles, Terry managed to high center himself, so after applying the use of his high lift jack and some judicial rock stacking, he was freed and we continued. Then Ray managed to do the same thing a little farther down the trail. While he was in his hung-up position, we discovered the cap to one of his front axle u-joints had lost it's c-clip and was about to fall out. Ray put some duct tape around it and went to two wheel drive. We then un-hung him with the aid of Jacob's winch. It was then discovered that we were only a few hundred yards from the "CAVE", so Ray took the by-pass and we regrouped there. What a relief from the heat. I think we all could have stayed there a few hours. Immediately after exiting the "CAVE", we came to an obstacle called Carnage Corner. I and Terry successfully navigated through it, with Paul and Jacob opting to go around. Since it was only a short way to the Rock Garden from there, Ray left his Bronco and proceeded on foot while the rest of us went to what looked like the turn around point. After hiking up the trail a ways, we say that there were a few hundred yards of trail left and also met a bunch of Jeeps that ![Battlement Mesa](/images/terry/trail/tr079802.jpg) were getting ready to head back down. Paul and Ray decided to head back out using the by-pass road. I, Terry, and Jacob decided to finish the trail. After all the Jeeps passed, we headed on up the trail. After a few obstacles, Terry somehow got his Jeep tweaked and it protested by its fan trying to eat its radiator. After un-tweaking him and a little fixing of the radiator, we continued. Another couple hundred yards and we climbed out of the creek bed and onto the road out. It had to be one of the dustiest, longest roads around. In the future it would be much better to turn around and go out the way we went in. Anyway, we eventually made it back to camp. 

I think everyone found Road 21 a great trail and we will definitely have to do it again. Next time, spring or fall, when it is cooler seems a little more appealing.
