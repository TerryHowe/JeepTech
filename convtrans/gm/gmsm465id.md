# GM SM465

#### by [Terry L. Howe](mailto:txh3202@worldnet.att.net)

The SM465 is a heavy duty, granny, 4 speed transmission used in
Chevy and GM trucks.  The large ribbed cast iron case makes it
easy to identify.

It is an excellent 4 speed to swap into a
Jeep with a Chevy engine.  The SM465 has an unusual large input
bearing retainer, it does not use the standard GM size.  It is
normally best to buy a matching bell housing with the transmission.

Rumor is, the late 70s to 81 GMC trucks were available with a
Oldsmobile 5.7L diesel and SM465.  The bell housing used in this
truck would be useful to mate an SM465 with a Buick engine since
this engine should have the BOP/BOC pattern.  The other option to
mate a Buick or Caddy engine to an SM465 is get a BOP/BOC bell housing
machined out.  This adds to the cost and who knows if it would
compromise the strength of the bell housing.
