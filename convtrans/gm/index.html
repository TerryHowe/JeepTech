<p>
The low cost and high availability of GM transmissions makes them
excellent fodder for a swap into a Jeep truck.  A GM transmission
makes more sense if your Jeep truck already has a GM engine or if
you plan to swap in a GM engine.  In the late 60s and early 70s,
Jeep pickups and Wagoneers used the Buick 350 engine and the CJs
used the Buick 225.  If a transmission swap is planned for these
vehicles, a GM transmission is the best bet.</p>

<a href="/convtrans/gm/gmsm465id.html">SM465</a>: The
SM465 is the strongest of the heavy duty 4 speeds.  It is a great
transmission, but its unusual input bearing retainer size makes it
most suitable for a Jeep with a Chevy engine.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
</td><td>
<a href="/convtrans/gm/gmsm420id.html">SM420</a>: The
SM420 is the older of the GM heavy duty 4 speeds.  It is an
excellent transmission to use with your Chevy or Buick powered
Jeep.
