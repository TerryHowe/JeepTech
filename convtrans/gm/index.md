# GM Transmissions

#### by [Terry L. Howe](mailto:txh3202@worldnet.att.net)

The low cost and high availability of GM transmissions makes them
excellent fodder for a swap into a Jeep truck.  A GM transmission
makes more sense if your Jeep truck already has a GM engine or if
you plan to swap in a GM engine.  In the late 60s and early 70s,
Jeep pickups and Wagoneers used the Buick 350 engine and the CJs
used the Buick 225.  If a transmission swap is planned for these
vehicles, a GM transmission is the best bet.
