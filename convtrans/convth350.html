<P>
The Turbo 350, aka TH350, automatic transmission is a stout 3
speed automatic transmission.  It has been used in various GM
cars and trucks over the years.  Because it is a reliable,
common, and short transmission, it is probably the best
automatic transmission to swap in a short Jeep such as a
flat fender or CJ-5.</p>
<p>
Swapping a TH350 into your Jeep does not make much sense unless
It is used with a GM engine.  The engine adapter is not available
for all engines used in Jeep vehicles and it adds to the cost of
the conversion.  An adapter of some sort will be required to bolt
a TH350 to a Jeep transfer case.</p>


<h3>TH350 vs. TH400</h3>
<p>
Some people will argue that a TH400 is everything a TH350 is, but
it is stronger.  It is a stronger transmission, but there are a
couple important advantages to the TH350.  The biggest advantage
of the TH350 is that is is 3&quot; or 4&quot; shorter than the
TH400.  It would be very difficult to fit a TH400 in a pre '72
CJ and hard to do for a '72â€“'83 CJ-5.  The couple inches makes
a big difference which makes it an excellent choice for a short
Jeep.  The other advantage is the TH350 is more efficient than
the TH400.  The Turbo 400 wastes more power than the Turbo 350,
so the Turbo 350 will have a snappier feel.</p>
