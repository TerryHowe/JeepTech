# Dodge NP435

The NP435 is a heavy duty, granny, 4 speed transmission used in
Dodge, Ford, and Chevy trucks.  The Ford version is a better
canidate for swap into a Jeep vehicle because most AMC equipped
Jeeps are compatible with Ford transmissions and the Ford version
is easier to find.  The Ford version will normally be cheaper
as well.
