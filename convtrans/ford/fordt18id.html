The Ford version of the T-18 was used approximately from 1967
until 1984.  It is a heavy duty four speed manual transmission
that is available in wide and close ratio, but I've only seen
the wide ratio version in Ford trucks.  The transmission weighs
close to 150 pounds.</p>

The case and the top of the transmission are cast iron.  The
Ford version uses the standard Ford "butterfly" bolt pattern
and a 1 1/16" 10 spline input shaft.  The input shaft is around
6 1/2" long.  The input shaft is about 1/2" shorter than the
Jeep T-18 input shaft.  The closely related Ford T-98 typically
uses a fatter input shaft.  The drivers side of the case will be
cast with T-18 or 13-01.  If you click on the top thumbnail, you
can see the 13-01 casting number in that picture.
<p>
There will normally be a PTO cover plate found on the passenger
and/or drivers side.  There are two shift patterns used, one
where reverse is out and up and the other where reverse is out
and back.  The out and back is the later version.</p>
<p>
There are generally two styles of output for the 2WD version
of the Ford T-18, the long slip yoke style shown in the top
picture and a short regular yoke style.  The 4WD versions of
the Ford T-18 tend to use long adapters and 31 spline outputs.
