The SM465 is the replacement for the SM420.  It's first gear isn't as
low, but it has a sturdier case and uses a larger input bearing.  Input
bearing retainer size may also be larger though, so finding a
bellhousing for anything other than a Chevy SB is not possible from
the junk yard.  It is also a bit longer than an SM420 which may be
a concern for CJ-5 and earlier Jeeps.
