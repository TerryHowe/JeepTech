(4WD version of the Ford NP435)
<p>
There are Ford, Chevy, and Dodge versions of the NP435.  The best
version for most Jeep owners would be the Ford version, but even
this version has some variations in the crucial input bearing
retainer size.  The advantage of this transmission is the first
gear is slightly lower than first on a wide ratio T-18.  Second
gear is also lower giving this transmission smaller a gap between
first and second than the T-18.</p>
