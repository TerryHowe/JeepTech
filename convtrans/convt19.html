<P>
There is overlap between the life of Borg-Warners heavy duty four
speeds, but basically the T-19 followed
the T-18.  The T-19 was the first one to offer a synchronized first
gear.  Typically, this meant that first gear wasn't as low.  The
exception to this rule was the rare wide ratio T-19 used in IH trucks.
Wide a close ratio versions of the T-19 were used in IH trucks, so
most T-19s in IH trucks are not the wide ratio version.  The T-19
was also used in Ford trucks.</p>
<P>
The input bearing retainer size (4.85") and often the input
shaft length is compatible with the bell housing used with the
T-150, T-176, T-5, T-4, SR-4 and of course Jeep T-18.
The input shaft length varies depending on the application,
but the shaft can be cut and resplined or an input shaft
of the appropriate length can  be installed.
If this transmission is to be used with a Jeep Dana 300, it is easiest
and cheapest to buy a 2WD Ford version.  The 4WD IH version should be
bolt compatible with a Dana 20 or Dana 18, but input shafts are
typically on the long side.</p>
