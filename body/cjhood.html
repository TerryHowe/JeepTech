If you don't get stuck, you aren't wheeling, you aren't testing
your limits and the limits of your vehicle.  There is no shame
in getting stuck, but it is a shame to dent your freshly painted
hood.  A simple reinforcement of the hood area can prevent dents
that damage the paint.</p>
<p>
After a weekend of wheeling which included crawling out on the
hood to catch a strap, I figured it was time to add some
reinforcement to prevent dents.  I had recently purchased a
welder, so I figured this would be a good harmless project
to practice my welding skills.  The reinforcement could be built
with out a welder, by welding makes it easier and cleaner.</p>
<p>
All that was required in materials was about 8 feet of 1"x1"x1/8"
angle.  A circular hands saw with a metal cutting blade was used
to cut four lengths, two to span the hood front to back, a short
one for the front, and slightly longer piece for the back.  A
miter saw would be excellent to make the slightly odd angle cuts,
but I didn't have one, so I just notched out the pieces to fit
together.</p>
<p>
The four pieces where welded together on the floor and several
holes where drilled in the front and back pieces for #10 sheet
metal screws.  Several matching holes where drilled in the hood
through the hood hat sections (not down through the hood).</p>
<p>
Once it is screwed in, the hood is much firmer.  Now I wouldn't
go jumping on it, but now when I crawl out to pull out the winch
cable or catch a strap, there are no worries.</p>
