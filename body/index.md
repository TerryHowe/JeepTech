|  | Off-Your Rocker Corner Guards for Project Pieces & Parts
:
Project Pieces & Parts gets rid of some ratty corners by installing
Off-Your Rocker Corner Guards. These corners aren't poseur aluminum
cover-ups, these corners are heavy duty steel diamond plate. |

|  | Durabak for Project Pieces and Parts
:
For Project Pieces and Parts, Durabak not only provides a tough, skid
resistant finish, it hides body work.  Applying the product is easy,
and the finish is outstanding. |
|  | TJ Flares on a CJ
:
Don Barker tells us how he installed TJ flares on his CJ to increase
tire clearance so he could run bigger meats.  They also keep his CJ
street legal by providing a marker light and keeping a fender over
the tire. |
|  | RockWare Bumper Review
:
RockWare has recently introduced a new bumper for CJs and Wranglers.
The bumper integrates a winch mount into the bumper which gives the
bumper a very clean appearance. |
|  | Hood Reinforcement:
If you don't get stuck, you aren't wheeling, you aren't testing
your limits and the limits of your vehicle.  There is no shame
in getting stuck, but it is a shame to dent your freshly painted
hood.  A simple reinforcement of the hood area can prevent dents
that damage the paint. |
|  | Pieces & Parts - Frame and Bumper Fab
:
Fame and bumper fabrication for the Jeep Tech Editors
CJ-2A Project Pieces & Parts.  Ideas on building
a stout flat fender frame and bumpers for a minimalist. |
|  | Frame Boxing and Gusseting
:
The frame work for Project Pieces and Parts wasn't done after simply
chopping up and splicing together the '73 Commando frame to flat
fender specifications.  There was still a large frame crack to
fix near the front spring mount, the splices to reinforce, body
mounts to build, and some frame boxing to do. |
|  | On-Board Air:
Obi-Wan shares his Jedi knowledge on converting a York air-conditioning
compressor for on-board air.  A complete page on building on on-board
air system with links to many other great on-board air articles. |
|  | Hi-Lift/Jack-All Mount:
Terry Morris shows us how he securely mounted his Hi-Lift jack, out of
the elements and out of the way. |
|  | Simple CJ Frame Fix:
Many '76-'86 CJs you look at will be suffering some frame rust around the rear spring hanger.
Eventually, this rust will become severe and the rear spring hanger will rip off, especially under
hard use. Fixing this problem is not as hard or expensive as you might think. |
|  | Jeep Heater Motor Upgrade:
Keep out the winter cold by upgrading your heater motor to a high output one from an early 70s Chevy truck. |
|  | Flat Fender Look:
Mark Sailer contributes information on giving you round fender CJ or Wrangler the flat fender look.  It not only looks cool, it increases tire clearance and gives you a tighter turning radius. |
|  | Jeep CJ Spare Parts Tire
Carrier: Keep an entire front axle outer on your spare tire
carrier! |

you're on the trail or in the garage. |
