If you don't get stuck, you aren't wheeling, you aren't testing
your limits and the limits of your vehicle.  There is no shame
in getting stuck, but it is a shame to dent your freshly painted
hood.  A simple reinforcement of the hood area can prevent dents
that damage the paint.

The frame work for Project Pieces and Parts wasn't done after simply
chopping up and splicing together the '73 Commando frame to flat
fender specifications.  There was still a large frame crack to
fix near the front spring mount, the splices to reinforce, body
mounts to build, and some frame boxing to do.

Many '76-'86 CJs you look at will be suffering some frame rust around the rear spring hanger.
Eventually, this rust will become severe and the rear spring hanger will rip off, especially under
