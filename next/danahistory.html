> Clarence Spicer is the inventor of the Cardon Cross U-joint. His company
> got into financial difficulties in the teens and hired a lawyer, Charles
> Dana, to help save the company. Charles was so impressed with the
> potential that he invested $25,000 dollars in the company which gave him
> controlling ownership (1914). Clarence remained the head engineer and
> Charles the business manager. Under Dana's agressive management, the
> Spicer Co. purchased many other automotive companies, one of the early
> acquisitions was Salisbury Wheel in 1919, which became the axle division
> that builds the axles we love. When Charles resigned from chairman of
> the board in the early 50's, the board voted to rename the company to
> honor Charles Dana who built the company. It has been the same company
> since long before the Jeep was invented. They are commonly called Dana
> axles now, but the change was a marketing decision not directly related
> to any buyout. The axles are still made by the Spicer Axle Division. The
> light truck and passenger car axles are a small line for them. They
> build axles for everything, including large trucks and heavy equipment.
