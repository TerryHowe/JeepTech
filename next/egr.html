         Since egr valves are vacuum operated devices, and you need egr
when
         there is no vacuum , some earliy designs used egr amplifiers.
         This is a divice that used manifold, ported, and venturi vacuum
to try
         to get vacuum to the valve when needed.  Another way to try to
make
         egr valves more efficent
         it to use backpressure transducers. At a cruise situtation,
there is
         no load an a engine, and egr is not needed. All it would do is
to add
         misfire to the motor and pollute. So by reading the
backpressure in
         the exhaust, manufactures can determine when to apply the egr
charge.
          Most of the newer egr valves 
         were backpressure transduced, a small hole is drilled on the
exhaust
         side of the valve to read how much backpressure is in the
exhaust. On
         other designs, they used a seperate
         backpressure transducer valve to control the time when the egr
valve
         is pulled, this is probably what is on your 3.8.
         Another note that I should point out about the use of cam
overlap as
         a egr device.  It will only work on normally asperated engines.
If you
         use a turbo or a blower, under boost
         situtations, the intake charge will just blow out the exhaust.
So the
         addition of a supercharger, or turbo, to a newer designed
         engine with long overlap times is not recommended without
changing the
         cam. 
         Terry, at high altitude, we do not have the barometric pressure
at sea
         level. And thus we have less cylinder perssure, and egr valves
arn't
         really necessary unless you are running
         high compression. When was the last time you ever heard a car
pinging?
         Did you also note that the octane rating at our fuel pumps is
about
         4 points
         lower than in New Jersey? Detationation isn't  a problem here,
so they
         dump poorer grade fuels on us. So why
         is avaition gas such high octane?

         EGR systems greatly increase both horsepower and efficency. By putting
         inert exhaust gas into the combustion chamber, it will lower the combustion
         temp. and thus reduce nox. Now by lowering the combustion temps. you
         can advance ign. timing and get greater cyld. pressure at a lower temp.
         and much more horsepower. The EGR valve is only one part of the system,
         and not very efficent. The reason for this is the EGR valve is a vacuum
         controlled device, and when you need it to work there is no vacuum.
         This is why the newer Ford and G.M. systems use electric solenoids to
         operate the EGR valves.  By diluting the intake charge by 5% with inert
         exhaust gas, you will use %5 less fuel, this is where the efficency
         part comes from.  
          The other part of the system, and probably the most important part,
         is the cam.  By using 35 to 40 deg. of cam overlap, the intake charge
         is getting both intake and exhaust charge as the piston is pulled down.
         So most of the EGR is done through cam overlap. The draw back of this
         is that EGR is occuring at idle, and as you know, the engine won't idle
         with EGR charge. The way around this is the use of a smog pump.  By
         putting fresh air in the exhaust manifold, EGR is cancelled, because
         the valve overlap is now going to draw in fresh air from the pump instead
         of exhaust gas. This is why on the new TPI chevy motors they use an
         electric air pump, it is only used at idle to cancel EGR. If you cut
         the smog pump belt on a SVO Mustang, it won't idle, because it can't
         cancle the EGR flow from the cam overlap. Hope this helps!
