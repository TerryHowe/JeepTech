I am working on a web write-up helping anyone put a TBI fuel injection
system on almost anything,  Most of it is what I learned by installing
and modifying extensively my Howell system... When the page is done
anyone should be able to do a TBI swap to their Jeep for less than half
the money of Howell and with more options... Please let me know of any
questions you have on the site as it will help me make it better for
everyone..  As of now its not complete but I am working on it daily..
thanks for any input and feel free to send questions my way,  later
