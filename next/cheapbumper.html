Rear bumper is 52" long 4" x 4" angle iron, the frame mount hole takes a
5/8" head bolt.  I also used this size for the eight attaching bolts
5/8" head, 1-1/2" long.  I used two washers above the strap that ties in
the frame to the bumper, but if you planned out the bumper placement in
advance this would not be necessary, as you could mount the bottom of
the bumper flush with the bottom of the frame.  Tow hook bolts are same
size as in front, but the bottom bolt I used for the frame tie in strap
was 3-1/2" long, too long as you can see from the pics it should have
been 3".  You can't really tell in my photos but I have the safety chain
brackets incorporated into my receiver, if your going to tow, this is
important
