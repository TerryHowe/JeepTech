         [JP] Warn OD rebuild, continued...

Life pulled me away from the OD for several weeks. I've got the
planetary gear all put together (drilled the pins) but was usure about
doing the other half when I won't be installing it for quite a while
(mostly due to the fact that AA uses a different keeper system, grease
rather than a roll pin, for the forward most synchro).  Then another
look revealed that I could proceed and safely finish the rebuild without
worry that it would sit in a box for a while.  So I got into it again
and found that the seal for the shift fork didn't fit the casting. 
Another AA change to deal with.

So the word from Advance Adapters is this:  The o-ring (which fit) is
unique to the Warn unit and the AA unit uses the seal instead.

I'm hoping for confirmation from the list(s) about this.  To those who
have a Saturn, can you tell me what the shift shaft seal is like
(strictly the oil-seal flush with the outside of the casting with no
internal o-ring).  To those with Warn units do you have something
besides the o-ring. I have the o-ring groove but don't have a seal.  The
shaft hole is enlarged on the external side of the o-ring groove,
however.  My unit was a little incomplete when I got it so I can't be
sure at this point that this void should be empty.  If so then any Warn
with the rear exiting shifter shaft should have the outside 1/4" or so
of the casting full of grease and dirt between the housing and the
shaft. If this is too confusing I'll try to get some photo's out there
or resort to ASCII art.

thanks

If I understand you right, and if I remember right, (two big ifs) there is
no seal. Are you talking about the upper right rear where he shift linkage
connects? A shaft goes into the housing and moves in and out. The shaft has
a ball held by a spring that fits into notches in the shaft to hold it
stable in each position. I don't remember a seal on the shaft. I'll find the
exploded diagram of the Saturn if you want confirmation. I've had mine out
twice in the last year, but maybe my mind is self editing.

Jeff,

>From memory, my Warn OD only has an o-ring. I don't see why
you would need both anyway. Either one should do the job.
