- Good cancellation of u-joint angles within 1 degree
- Operating angles less than 3 degrees
- At least 1/2 degree continuous operating angle for
  prop shaft

Example

Output yoke 3 degrees
Prop shaft  4.9 degrees
Trans Output
Operating angle = 1.9 degrees

Axle input yoke 3.2 degrees
Prop shaft      4.0 degrees
Axle input
operating angle = 1.7 degrees

Trans Output operating angle 1.9 degrees
Axle Input operating angle  -1.7 degrees
U Joint cancellation         0.2 degrees
