Right to left, '77 and newer FSJ spindle, Scout II spindle 
(disc braked CJ spindle is the same but uses 6 bolts to mount to the 
knuckle while Scout II uses 8), 
F-150 (solid-reverse cut- coil spring dana 44) spindle and brake caliper. 
Note how the Ford caliper bracket mounts between the spindle and knuckle but 
can use the same type of calipers as an early CJ disc setup or Scout II.
<br><br>
My '74-'76 FSJ spindles are currently in use, but I'll probably pull 
the front end apart for some pictures next Winter. I also have a drum 
brake CJ spindle that I forgot to shoot.
<br><br>

Dana 44 3 series Trac Lock.<br><br>
<img src="44-3.jpg"><br>
End view of the setup I use to remove carrier bearings.<br><br>
<img src="44-4.jpg"><br>
3 series Trac Lock on the left, 3 series open carrier on the right has the 
bearing splitter on it. The 2 jaw puller 
I use with the bearing splitter is in the foreground.<br><br>
I just got a 4 series open carrier (was in the back of the Willys Wagon), 
I'll probably shoot a comparison shot of it and the 3 series next time 
I have the camera out in the garage. I'll probably shoot some comparisons 
of a set of 3.07s next to some 5.38s as well. <br><br>
<img src="44-5.jpg"><br>
Right is a '77 and later drivers side FSJ knuckle, 
left is a CJ drivers side knuckle. I'd like to get my hands on a '74-'76 
FSJ knuckle to show why it works for spring over arms and the '77 and later 
won't, but I don't know how long that will take. <br><br>
<img src="44-6.jpg"><br>
'77 and newr FSJ knuckle, spindle and brake backing plate. Only the brake 
backing plate is the same as the '74 to '76 parts. <br><br>

<img src="44-7.jpg"><br>
Right '77 and newr FSJ spindle, left Scout II disc brake spindle.<br.<br>
<img src="44-8.jpg"><br>
My small pile of Dana 44s. Top is a narrow track Wagoneer axle 
(sitting upside down), Middle is a Scout II front end 
(also sitting upside down), bottom is a Scout II rear end.
