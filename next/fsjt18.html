  I just finished swapping the input shaft from a Ford T-18 into a Jeep 
truck T-18.  It was *much* easier than I thought it would be.  I took 
copious amounts of pictures and will try to write the whole thing up and 
put it on the web soon.
  I also got a bunch of pictures on the Scout D300 install (esp. shots of 
the D300 vs D20 bull gear) and the custom twin-stick I made using D18 
levers and some of the truck's D20 linkage parts...

  I have also seen a long-shaft in a CJ-7, but it was with a 360 and I am 
not sure the engine was in the stock location.  I would be there is no 
way it would go in a 5, however, since my new driveshaft with the short 
input is only 16 1/2" long.

  The whole works is complete w/ T-150 bellhousing, AA pilot bushing, and 
NAPA clutch.  Now is the time if anyone wants any pictures.  It is 
waiting for 3 strong guys to either help me get it in or come over some 
night and steal it... :-)

         Q's on mounting T-18 to bellhousing

  Is there any trick to mounting the Jeep truck T-18 to the T-150 
bellhousing?  I know about the bolt with the ground-down head to clear 
the clutch throwout fork, but some of the other bolt holes on the tranny 
look much bigger than their bellhousing counterparts.  What is the 
solution?

  Do you redrill the BH and tap it?
  Do you through-drill the BH and bolt it?
  Do you sleeve the holes in the tranny and use the smaller bolts?
  Do you stick with the T-150/D20 setup?

  Also, how many bolts do you need to consider it well-mounted?  I am 
shooting for strength and reliability, as I do not want to be messing 
around with this again...

Mike (T-18/D300 just itching to go in...)

  And the winner is: Bill!  Or at least he was closest.  The actual 
winner was Alan Adolphsen, head mechanic at East Coast Rover Co., but I 
did not talk to him until after I had figured it out.  He ran into the 
same problem on a friend's 74 CJ that he did.

:-)

  The thing that kept my clutch from disengaging was that the front 
bearing retainer was too long and was contacting the clutch disc, forcing 
it against the flywheel!  The pressure plate was working normally the 
whole time, as was the throwout bearing.
  To fix it:

  First, I called NAPA and double-checked the part numbers they sold me 
to verify that they were the correct ones.

  Next, I spent the day yanking the old girl apart (no easy task on 
something that heavy!)  I was expecting to see the clutch disc installed 
backwards, just like all the rest of you were... :-)

  Obviously, the problem was obvious as hell, with the bearing retainer 
worn down and peened over (the 81 Ford one is aluminum and I had run it 
for 5-10 minutes total trying to figure it out).  The bad news is that it 
was peened over inside and out, which prevented it from coming off.  It 
also prevented the throwout bearing from coming off.

  I had to yank the bellhousing to get the retainer past the little 
spring that holds the throwout fork on.  Then I unbolted the bearing 
retainer.  I put 2 of the bolts in the holes on the retainer so I could 
turn it with a screwdriver.  Someone else put a file (tapered handle end 
first) in the splines on the input shaft and held the shaft with a pair 
of pliers.  I then turned the retainer while the file deburred the inside 
of the retainer.  Once it would come off, we dressed the end down with a 
file until the throwout bearing came off.

  After the bearing came off, we put 2 bolts through opposite holes and 
clamped the 2 bolts in the vise to hold it.  We put a rag in the hole so 
filings would not go down into the seal.  And then started filing.

  To determine the correct amount, we first compared it to the T-150 one. 
 By then they were about the same length. :-)  However, the splined area 
on the clutch discs were not the same length.  The new clutch was 1/8" 
thicker.

  We set the T-150 front bearing retainer on a metal bench, and then 
perched the disc on top.  We did the same with the T-18 and new disc, and 
measured the total height difference.  We then filed the Ford retainer 
until the combined height was about 1/8" less than the T-150 setup.

  I have no idea what the stock dimensions of the Ford retainer were 
prior to this disaster.  Alan said that he cut 3/8" off the one he did in 
order to get it to clear the disc.  There was enough leeway so we 
probably could have cut an inch off without impacting the riding surface 
of the throwout bearing, but I think measuring it is the safest way to go.

  Before I cut it down, my starter would just barely crank hard enough to 
start the motor because of the resistance.  Afterward, I could reach in 
the inspection plate and move the flywheel by hand (esp. with 100k on the 
motor :-).  This is a good test.  Either the distance was so close or the 
disc flexed enough that there was no indication of this problem when 
bolting the bellhousing together.  It went together well.

  I checked the clutch disc against the flywheel and pressure plate, and 
if it were installed backwards the clutch disc would still not hit on 
anything because of the clearances.  I'm not sure how it would like being 
driven in the opposite direction, however.

  Why have I never heard any mention of this problem, on any of the lists 
or in the AA catalog?!

  Thanks for playing The Clutch Is Right!

NB:  I salvaged the weekend with a day of hard wheeling in the rain 
today.  I absolutely cannot believe the difference in the way the Jeep 
goes.  No more beating it up over obstacles at Warp 9 or slipping the 
clutch.  It shifts a lot harder than the T-150 and takes some getting 
used to, but it was well worth the aggravation.

  I consolidated these to simplify the reply.  Here is how it worked out:

  My brother is in the process of building a Scout project.  He is

  My brother is in the process of building a Scout project.  He is
putting a 1970 IH 304/T-18/D20/PTO winch setup in a 1980 Scout chassis.
That had had the Nissan diesel replaced with an AMC 258 with Offy intake,
headers, and Rochester 2-bbl.  Everything else was stock.  He gave me the
whole shebang, including the close-ratio T-19 and Scout D300.  Free.  I
held onto that thing for years.

  I picked the Jeep T-18 up for $300, with truck BH and D20.  It was out
of a mid-70's Jeep truck.  The input shaft is 2 1/2, maybe 3 miles long.

  I picked up a T-18 from a 1981 2WD Ford van for $75 in the local swap &
sell-it.

  I got an AA Ford-AMC pilot bushing for $23 from them.  Up to $400 so
far.

  Driveshafts were $190.  I used a pair of driveshafts from a Jeepster.
That way both tubes needed only to be cut down, not lengthened.  To
balance them, they put new u-joints in them.  One yoke needed to be
replaced.
  I was surprised to find that not only did they use spicer u-joints, but
that the Spicer joints were cheaper than the NAPA joints I had been
using.  In addition, the NAPA guys had recomended not using NAPA joints
because of lubrication problems and using Spicer instead, which they
carried for much more money.  I had the driveshafts done a Brake Service,
a chain of stores here in Maine (and maybe elsewhere) that deals mostly
in big truck parts.

  So, I put the Ford shaft in the Jeep tranny, used the Scout gear,
adapter, and transfer case.  Put in the AA pilot bushing, and modified
the T-150 tranny mount to line up with the Scout adapter plate.  Put on
the driveshafts, and away I went, at 59:1.
  I used the 79 crossmember just the way it was.  I lowered it 3/4" with
some home made spacers to approximate a factory setup.  I still have some
vibration to work out.  The crossmember has enough holes in it that it
wasn't hard to work up another tranny mount.  I did not have to drill
anything.
  I felt no need to rebuild the T-18.  It looked very good inside, and
the person I got it from said it was in excellent shape.  I figured it
wouldn't be getting used very hard in a CJ.

  If I had the money, I would take a ride to the Cape tomorrow and snap
up Rick B.'s T-18.  The way I did it was a hassle.  However, now that I
have done it, I think for my wife's Jeep I will try to hunt up a Ford
T-19 and swap the IH mainshaft in.  She loves the way the T-150 shifts,
T-19 and swap the IH mainshaft in.  She loves the way the T-150 shifts,
and the T-18 just can't come close for smoothness.

  I did not include the clutch parts, and also forgot the tranny mount.
These are things I would have had to do even if I kept the T-150.

  Not sure.  I put a Ford bearing retainer on a Jeep T-18 and had to cut
it down ~3/8" to get it to clear.  It was rubbing hard against the clutch
disk before I cut it and had peened over the whole nose.  I had to take
it off the tranny and spend 1/2 hour with a file before I could get the
throwout bearing off.
  Surprisingly, I had never read anything about having to modify the nose
of the Ford tranny for a Jeep.  One other person I know has had the exact
same problem swapping the Ford input parts into a Jeep T-18.
  Anyone else on the list ever seen this?
