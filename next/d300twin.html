<p>
A twin stick shifter for the Dana 300 can be fabricated fairly
easily.  A twin stick shifter for the Dana 300 will make shifting
easier and allow some shift combinations that are not available
with the single stick shifter.  A twin stick shifter will allow
easy shifting into front wheel drive low and rear wheel drive low.
A detent on the shift rails prevents front wheel drive high.
The best part about the twin stick conversion is it looks cool.</p>
<p>
A second stock Dana 300 shift lever is required to do the conversion.
</p>

<p>
The single flat piece of metal with the two holes that slides into the
slot on the shift rails has two problems if you are trying to do this
at home and you don't have the right tools.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
If it is not machine accurately the rotational forces when pushing lever
back (bottom part forward) makes the plate rotate around the pin in the
shift rail.
</li>

<li>
If the thicker part of the new adapter is not think enough the shifter
will slip out of the big hole when the above happens. The stock
adapter that links the two shiftrails together has the hole about
3/4" above the middle of the shifter rails. The stock hole aligns
with the thin part above the "ball" on the bottom of the shifter.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
After trying the above and not being very successful I finally did the
following.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Drilled the second shifter lever to go over the pivot pin. Mine actually
turned out to have too much play after drilling so I used some copper
water pipe that happened to be the exact size to act as a bushing in
between. You want the shifter to rotate around the pin with the minimum
of play. The new shifter goes in between the two tabs that the pin slide
into. The old shifter stays in the stock position.
</li>

<li>
Got two pieces of pipe about 1 1/2" long that slides over the shifter
rails with minimum clearance. Kinda like a bushing. By doing this you
eliminate any rotation problems of the connecting block.
</li>

<li>
Drilled a 1/4" hole in each in the center. This is for the pin, I just
bought two longer 1/4" cottepins and ground them down a bit to fit.
</li>

<li>
Made two "tabs" to weld to the side. Drilled each one with a bigger hole
to accept the bottom of the shifter. The easiest is to make the bushings
first, fit them over the shift rails and position them. Then determine
the best position for the tabs, based on the shifter positions etc. You
might have to bend the shifters to eliminate interference.
</li>

<li>
I then welded the tabs to the bushings. The tabs were positioned towards
the top side of the bushing and not in the middle. This allows for the
bottom of the shifter to stay in the hole and also align better (closer
to the stock position).
</li>

<li>
Assemble everything and check for interference. I had to bend the
shifters a little.
</li>
</ol>
