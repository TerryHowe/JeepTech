Terry-

You'd better wait so I can get comments and corrections.
Would hate to publish bad info.
If you know any electrical wizards, please have them look at it for 
corrections and/or additions.
Most of the info was gleaned and compiled from posts in Off Road and Parts 
Mike forums.
I have already had some good input and have made a few changes.
I still need some Oil Pressure gauge tests.
The illustrations are from a gauge kit and an after market Spedo from FWD 
Hardware that a guy sent me.

Glad you like it. It is sure something everybody has been needing.
I'll keep you informed as to progress.

By the way-

Take a look at Tim Weaver's 4.0 Head Conversion article that I just put up 
this last weekend.
Tim spent a lot of time compiling this into MS Word format. He had several 
folks, including myself add info since I had just done the conversion. His 
pics are bad so I added some from my CJ-7 Project. It was put on the web by 
a friend who did a poor job of it. Tim does not refer folks to that site 
with an earlier version any more.

Tim has recently been attaching the MS Word file to e-mails for interested 
parties.
He said he gets several requests per day.
Last week, with his permission, I took a copy - edited and reformatted it 
and posted it in my Monsterslayer site. I have a couple of more pics I want 
to add to it.

It is VERY good.
I just e-mailed him and suggested he omitted the second, intake port gasket 
on the re-assembly instructions.
I don't know if this is an MPI only thing or not. Anyway, it is fairly 
complete - except needing some better pics.
Check it out at ...

I like your Gauge Diagnostics page, are you interested in
publishing it on the Jeep Tech pages at Off-Road.com?  All
I can offer you is what I get paid, fame and glory.

What are thos pictures out of copyright wise?  That might
have to be replaced.

Anyway, liked the page.
