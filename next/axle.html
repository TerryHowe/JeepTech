<BR>
<STRONG>DANA 25/27</STRONG><BR>
These Danas are indistinguishable in appearance. The military Model 25 has
a thick, cast cover, while the 27 and civilian-model 25s have a thinner
cover, will accept taller gears, and backed V-6s.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR><STRONG>DANA 28</STRONG><BR>
The alloy-case Dana 28, with a 6 5/8-inch-diameter ring gear, came in Bronco
IIs and Rangers with anything but the 4.0-liter engine. Although 4.0-liter
trucks come with Dana 35s, most of the front suspension and/or drivetrain
needs to be swapped to replace a 28. <BR>
<BR>
<HR><IMG SRC="images/dana30.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="121" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><STRONG>DANA 30</STRONG><BR>
The Model 30, with a 7 1/8-inch-diameter ring gear, was the standard front
differential in some 1972-75 CJ-5s and all 1975-and-later CJ-5s and CJ-7s.
It is still used in the front of Cherokees and Comanches, and will probably
appear in the front of the Grand Cherokee. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR><IMG SRC="images/dana35.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="102" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><STRONG>DANA 35</STRONG><BR>
This axle, with a 7.56-inch ring gear, is the frontend for 4.0-liter Ford
Rangers and Explorers/Mazda Navajos. The 35C version is found in the rear
of Cherokees and Comanches.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR><IMG SRC="images/dana41.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="134" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><STRONG>DANA 41</STRONG><BR>
The 41, which has a ring gear size similar to the Dana 44, came in early
CJ-2As. The spiders are the same as a 44's, but the carrier and gears aren't.
It is almost universally swapped out in favor of a Dana 44.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR><IMG SRC="images/dana44.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="124" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><STRONG>DANA 44 </STRONG><BR>
All domestic manufacturers have used Dana axles, and the 44, with its 8
1/2-inch ring gear, is likely to be a step up on anything smaller than a
1/2-ton. A narrowed 44 could be the hot ticket for vehicles smaller than
a full-size sport-utility. It was standard under the front of pre-1976 Chevy
Blazers and 1/2-tons, solid front-axled F-150s and Broncos, and Jeep J-10/J-20s
and Grand Wagoneers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR> <IMG SRC="images/dana44ifs.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="112" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><STRONG>DANA 44-IF</STRONG><BR>
The Ford-version Dana 44 Twin-Traction-Beam setup is similar to other 44s
(ring gear diameters are identical), but there are no axle tubes and the
&quot;cover&quot; is actually the suspension arm. It's standard in the front
of any TTB-equipped Ford except the F-250HD, which uses a Dana 50.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR><IMG SRC="images/dana60.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="109" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><STRONG>DANA 60 </STRONG><BR>
A Dana 60 looks deceptively similar to a Dana 44, but the 60's 9 3/4-inch
ring gear diameter is a major factor in strength. It can be found in many
3/4-ton pickup and van rearends.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR> <IMG SRC="images/dana70.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="123" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><STRONG>DANA 70</STRONG><BR>
Almost identical in appearance to a Dana 60, the Dana 70 is standard in
heavy Dodge pickups and GM duallies. The large 10.54-inch ring gear diameter
will tolerate much torque, and is suitable for diesel power and/or big tires.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR><IMG SRC="images/ford7.5in.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="107" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><STRONG>FORD 7.5-INCH</STRONG><BR>
The small Ford rearend, which sometimes uses a fiberglass cover, is found
in Bronco IIs and non-4.0-liter-powered Rangers. For bigger tires and/or
engines, it's usually swapped for a Ford 9-inch.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR><IMG SRC="images/ford8.8in.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="104" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><B>FORD 8.8-INCH</B><BR>
The 8.8-inch debuted in 1983 Broncos and F-150s, and is now found also in
4.0-liter Rangers and Explorers/Navajos. It is easily distinguished from
a 9-inch by having a cover on the back.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR><IMG SRC="images/ford9in.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="96" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><STRONG>FORD 9-INCH</STRONG><BR>
The venerable Ford 9-inch is both readily available and strong. Later models
have bigger axle tubes and stronger housings. It was standard under 1966-88
F-150s and Broncos. It also came on many vans and the Lincoln Versailles
(a popular axle for swapping because of the Lincoln version's disc brakes
with parking brake).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR><IMG SRC="images/ford10.25in.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="106" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><STRONG>FORD 10.25-INCH</STRONG><BR>
Ford's biggest axle comes with semi-floating shafts in 1983-and-newer F-250s,
and as a full-floater in F-250HDs and F-350s. Applications are similar to
the big GM 14-bolt and the Dana 70.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR><IMG SRC="images/gm10bolt7.5in.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="107" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><STRONG>GM CORPORATE 10-BOLT</STRONG><BR>
The GM 10-bolt is named for the number of bolts on the cover; ring gear
diameter is 7 1/2 inches. Variations of this can be found in the rear of
GM S-trucks and some Isuzus, and in the front of S-trucks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR><IMG SRC="images/gm10bolt8.5in.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="116" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><STRONG>GM CORPORATE 10-BOLT</STRONG><BR>
This 10-bolt, with a larger 8 1/2-inch ring gear diameter, replaced the
Dana 44 that was used in the front of some pre-1977 GMs. It can also be
found in the back of 1983-91 1/2-tons and in the front of 1983-87 1/2-tons.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR><IMG SRC="images/gmcorporate12bolt.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="116" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><STRONG>GM CORPORATE 12-BOLT</STRONG><BR>
The stronger 12-bolt, with an 8 7/8-inch-diameter ring gear, can be found
in various 1964-82 GM 1/2- and 3/4-ton front- and rearends.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR><IMG SRC="images/gmcorp.14bolt9.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="112" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><STRONG>GM CORPORATE 14-BOLT </STRONG><BR>
The &quot;small&quot; GM 14-bolt has a 9 1/2-inch ring gear diameter. It
was used in the rear of 1964-and-later GM pickups, and in the rear of 1984-91
3/4-ton Suburbans.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR><IMG SRC="images/gmcorp.14bolt10.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="116" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><STRONG>GM CORPORATE 14-BOLT</STRONG><BR>
With a 10 1/2-inch-diameter ring gear, the biggest 14-bolt GM rearend looks
much like a Dana 70, and is but a few thousandths of an inch shorter in
ring gear diameter. This axle is commonly used with big engines and/or overly
large tires. It was used under 1973-87 3/4-tons.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR><IMG SRC="images/amcmodel20.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="116" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><STRONG>AMC MODEL 20</STRONG><BR>
Used in 1976-and-later Jeep CJs, the Model 20 rearend is both strong and
weak. An 8 3/4-inch-diameter ring gear provides strength; weaknesses are
the housing itself and the axle-to-hub retaining method. Converting to one-piece
axles or full-floaters gives this axle better stamina.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR><IMG SRC="images/chrysler914inch.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="107" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"><STRONG>CHRYSLER 9 1/4-INCH</STRONG><BR>
Mopar's 9 1/4-inch rearend can put a stop (notice the octagonal stop sign
cover shape) to rearend woes on many lesser-equipped vehicles. Chrysler
has used these since 1969, on 1/2- and 3/4-tons.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR><STRONG>TOYOTA 7.8-INCH</STRONG><BR>
Close to eight inches in ring gear diameter, this rearend has been used
on 1979-and-later 4Runners and pickups. The four-cylinder turbo and 1988-and-later
V-6 models have larger side carriers and the same ring size in front. <BR>
