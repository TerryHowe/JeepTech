  <font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="703222715-25032004">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's try it 
  this way.</span></font><div>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="703222715-25032004">Here is the 
    drawing of the frame and tub.&nbsp; It's not to scale, so don't take anything 
    that's unmarked literally.&nbsp; ie. I just noticed I've got the forward most 
    mount lined up with where the tub curves in.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure they don't 
    line up.</span></font></div>

  <div>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="703222715-25032004">The 13 5/8&quot; 
    measurement seemed to be the most consistent.&nbsp; It actually varied by about 
    1/4&quot; depending where you measured it.&nbsp; I didn't realize my rockers were so 
    wavy.&nbsp; All of the fore and aft measurements were taken from the part of the 
    tub where the floor steps up as shown below.</span></font></div>

    <font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="703222715-25032004">How far up do 
    the sliders go?&nbsp; Do they tie in to the front fenders at all?&nbsp; I think I'd 
    prefer it if they did, but I have two issues on the driver's side.&nbsp; I still 
    have the through the floor pedals, so I'm going to need a cutout for that.&nbsp; 
    I marked it on the drawing, but after thinking about it, I can probably cut 
    that out later.&nbsp; For that matter, I could drill the body mount holes as 
    well.&nbsp; The other thing is I have a remote mounted oil filter that lives next 
    to the clutch pedal as shown.</span></font></div>

  <div>
    <font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="703222715-25032004">I would like 
    the slider to protect it, but it would be really nice if there was an easily 
    removable hatch that I could take off when I need to get to it.&nbsp; How tough 
    would that be to do?&nbsp; I suppose I could also get to it by taking off the 
    fender.&nbsp; Maybe that would be better.&nbsp; What do you think?&nbsp; Here's another 
    view of it.</span></font></div>

    <font face="Arial" size="2"><span class="703222715-25032004">The pass side 
    is pretty straight forward. Nothing hangs down there.&nbsp; Is there anything 
    else you need?&nbsp; Are there any other pictures you need for your website?&nbsp; I'd 
    be happy to take any views you need. &nbsp;I could also bring the Jeep up to 
    Cheyenne when I come up.&nbsp; Would that make it easier?&nbsp; I'd like to bend your 
    ear a bit about how to go about replacing the floor.&nbsp; Also, do you have any 
    pictures of the sliders?&nbsp; These are like the ones I saw when I visited you 
    right?&nbsp; I'm curious how they go around the step.&nbsp; Do you have any pictures 
    of that?</span></font></div>
