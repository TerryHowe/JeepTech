        Here is what the transmission situation was when I started.&nbsp; The T-90 tranny was bolted directly
        to the pinto bellhousing.&nbsp; This was accomplished by using an
        adapter ring around the input bearing retainer so it would index
        correctly to the bellhousing.&nbsp; All the attaching bolts hit on the
        flat part of the bellhousing, so all that was needed was to drill holes
        into the bellhousing and bolt it up.&nbsp; The tranny and transfercase was clocked
        downward to provide clearance for the front driveshaft.&nbsp; Also
        evident from this picture was the amount the tranny and transfercase was
        leaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <p><img border="0" src="../images/DriveshaftClearance2.JPG" width="589" height="394"></p>
        <p>Even after clocking the tranny and transfercase, the clearance was
        still pretty tight.&nbsp; If you look carefully, you can see where the
        driveshaft was still striking the starter mounting.&nbsp; Also visible
        is the spacing that was added to the cross member to clear the transfer
        case clocking, thus reducing ground clearance.&nbsp; I was also concerned
        how this clocking was affecting the lubrication of the
        transmission and transfer case, especially after the overdrive was
        added.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
