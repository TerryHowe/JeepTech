        I had originally planned to leave the steering alone or swap to a more
        conventional saginaw power steering gearbox mounted on the inside of the
        front frame rail like a '72 or newer CJ.&nbsp; This would have
        interfered with the planned PTO winch. (No sissy electrics for
        me.)&nbsp; The original crossmember didn't leave me much room for the
        winch either and that was required for the original steering
        setup.&nbsp; I had heard of Scout II power steering gear box swap from
        someone on Willys Tech, and decided that was the way to go.&nbsp; The
        Scout II box sits on top of the frame rail and behind the grill thereby
        keeping it out of the way of the winch, and keeping the steering shaft
        from interfering with the motor mounts which is sometimes a problem with
        other saginaw swaps.&nbsp; Since my engine was offset so far to the
        left, it would have undoubtedly been a problem with mine.
