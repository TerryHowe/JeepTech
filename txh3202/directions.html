<H2>Wharton State Forest</H2>
<P>
To get to Wharton State Forest from the Garden State Parkway, take
exit 50, to 542W to Batso.  The Ranger station will be on the right,
stop in and pickup a map and get information on what areas are off
limits to four wheeling.
<P>
Since Wharton is just a maze of criss-crossing trails, it is hard to
describe where to find the best trails.  Most trails rate a 2-3,
doable by stock 4x4, but some are more fun.  The "Pine Tree Trail"
at Wharton is fun if it is wet enough.  It probably normally
ranks about a 6, but at times it is very dry and you need to search
for a mud hole.  To get to it continue
on 542 West from the Ranger station, go over bridge and make a right
into or just beyond Church parking lot.  To the left of the church is
a wooden bridge with a road closed sign.  Take this trail until the
second (I think) large sandy clearing.  Take the trail to the right,
it can be a lot of fun.
<P>
Another good trail at Wharton is the "Sand Hill Trail".  It can be
just as difficult as the Pine Tree Trail, but most of the mud holes
have easy outs around them.  It also features Sand Hill which is a
fun little hill climb and the highest point in the park (101 ft) I
believe.  Sand Hill is tough to find unless you have topo maps or know where
you are going.  To get to the Sand Hill Trail, enter the road to the
Ranger Station and continue past the Ranger Station and past the Fire
tower to a dirt road on the left.  Take second or third left off
this road and bear right parallel to the original road.  This trail
should end and you take a left onto the good trail.  Sand Hill is on
a spur to the left off this trail and you can't really see it from the
main trail.

Old Florida Road in Savoy State Forest in North Western Mass is
one of the trails that is run on the Mohawk Trail Jeep Jamboree.
Traveling east on Rt. 2 just past the hairpin turn, is a road
called Central Shaft Rd.  Take a right on that road and Old
Florida Road is down a ways on the right.

<H2>Green Mountain National Forest</H2>
The legal trails in the Green Moutain national Forest can be found
by taking rt. 2 to rt. 8 North.  There is an entrance if you take
a left onto Mill Rd. just after the Stamford Church.  The trails are
down on the right.  You can also get on if you continue a little
further and bear right onto an old road over an old bridge to the
left.  Follow the forest road to the trail head on the right.  The
legality of these trails is unknown and they rate around a 8.  Winch
required.
