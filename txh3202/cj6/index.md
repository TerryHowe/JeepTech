# Terry Howe's '75 CJ-6

!['75 CJ-6](/txh3202/cj6/cj601.jpg)

I recently bought a '75 Jeep CJ-6 with 232(3.8L) I6, T-14 3 speed
transmission, Dana 20 transfer case, Dana 44 rear, and Dana 30 front
with 3.73s.  That makes it totally stock except for the hard top.

The rocker panels are a bit wavey and showing some rust.  The passenger
rear quarter panel had the spare tire ripped off it, but other than
that the body is in pretty good shape.  The previous owner did a paint
job of sorts, it looks good from a distance.

The wheels are real nice, but the tires are very bald 33s with no lift.
I'll probably throw on a set of 32s I have to keep it on the road.

This jeep will serve as my commuter vehicle until I get my flat
fender on the road.  After that serious modifications are in order.
