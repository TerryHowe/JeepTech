	Dave and Kelly led Brian in his black jeep, quest John in his red jeep,
Paul and Cindy in their flat fender and Curtis in his Bronco down the
highway to Texas Creek on a sunny Sunday...We decided to do the loop
instead of the rocks...Everything started out just fine but then we ran
into snow...at first it wasn't too bad but before we knew it got deeper and
deeper...Dave had some problems with getting stuck but he was "breaking
trail" for the rest of us...It actually came to a decission of go back or
go ahead...We figured that ahead would be better as behind
was not all that great...We made it to the hill...And wished we had turned
around...It was a mess the mud was the slimey nasty stuff and was hard to
get going in...Dave and Kelly got stuck...Paul managed to get by them and
then pulled them up the hill...then Brian and John tried both of them got
stuck and Brian winched himself up while Curtis got past John and helped
him up the hill by pulling him.  With clouds rolling in and dark creeping
up on us we ran down to the rocks really quick so all could see what they
looked like and then headed out. With mud flying from our tires we headed
down the highway to home.
