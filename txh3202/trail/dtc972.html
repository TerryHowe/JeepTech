<P>
After pretzeling my tie rod twice on Iceman, I opted to take it
easy the second day.   I did need to drive my Jeep home the next day
after all.  The trail I chose was Old Miner which is rated a 3 which
means it is a difficult trail for stock vehicles.</p>
<p>
The trail starts in Spearfish Canyon and climbs 1000 feet in the
first 3/4 mile up a tight switch back.  We continued across
several ridges and valleys through the ghost town of Carbonate
and stopped to check out the Carbonate cemetery.  Our trail leaders,
Mike Elston in his '91 Wrangler and tail gunner Douglas Jones in
his '66 CJ-5A, were familiar with much of the history of the area.
Mike filled us in on the different mining techniques used in the
area and the history of mining in the area.</p>

After Carbonate, we dropped into Chism Gulch and stopped for lunch
at the base of Heckman Hill, aka Widowmaker Hill.  Heckman Hill is
the most challenging part of the Old Miner and it requires lots of
throttle no matter what modifications you may have made to your vehicle.
A couple people locked front and rear and aired down tried to crawl
it, but it was too loose and steep.  Our tail gunner, Doug Jones,
took a short cut to avoid the hill.  The tired F-Head I4 in his
'66 CJ-5A lacked the horses to make the climb.  Everyone made the
climb after a few attempts and we dropped into Burno Gulch and
back out to pavement.  We finished up midafternoon and gathered
at a general store for some ice cream and cold drinks.  Most of us
decided to continue on to Mount Moriah.
