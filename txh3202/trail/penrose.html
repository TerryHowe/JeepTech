<p>
Royal Gorge district of the BLM has released their decision on the
Penrose OHV area extreme 4WD road development project proposed by one of
the clubs of the Colorado Association of 4WD Clubs. The preferred
alternative has been modified from 0.4 miles of 4WD road development
to 1.3 miles. This increase is due to the letters of support sent in
to date for this type of project. </p>
<p>
The decision by the Colorado RockHoppers 4WD Club is to accept the 1.3
miles of extreme 4WD road development in the Penrose area. They will
begin working on this with the Royal Gorge BLM as soon as the comment
period is over (Nov.  6th).  A reduced amount of volunteer activity
on the surrounding area will be their response to the reduced mileage
in the final decision. If more mileage is developed after the initial
12 months of monitoring, work on the access road to the Penrose area
and other volunteer projects will be entertained.</p>
<p>
We will need to support this decision in order to offset the inevitable
complaints from the local, and possibly national environmental groups
and activists.  The decision allows for a request of further review
prior to November 6th, 1998. If a person or group is opposed to this
decision they can request this further review, but must state the
reasons why. Further review will delay implementation, and could
change the decision.</p>
<p>
Send your comments, before November 6th, in support of the decision to:
<pre>
Donnie Sparks, District Manager
Royal Gorge Resource Area 
3170 East Main Street
Canon City, CO  81212
</pre>
Reference the Decision Record for the EA titled "Penrose Off-Highway
Vehicle Trails Authorization" (CO-057-98-126EA).</p>
<p>
Thanks for your support of Scott Riebel's, Jerry Panek's, and the
Colorado RockHoppers 4WD Club's efforts to develop the Penrose OHV
Area.</p>

As you know the infamous Rattler was closed late last year by the
BLM.  The reason the BLM gave for the closure was that the trail
produced "too much" sediment in the Badger Creek Basin and vegitation
damage on the trail.  Rather than reopen Rattler, the BLM agreed to
open an equally challenging area for new trails at another
location.  After analyzing maps, the BLM proposed the Penrose Chaining
Area because this area did not have any unique vegitation, there
was no running water in which to create sediment, and the area had
similar topography to Rattler.  The four wheelers agreed and produced
a map detailing the trails that would be used.</p>
<p>
Some argued that the Penrose Chaining Area was already an open OHV,
but the Penrose Chaining Area has a great potential and it would be
better to have officially sanctioned trails in the area rather than have
the area closed as Rattler was.  This compromise was agreed to,
but now the BLM wants to close down nearly all of the Penrose Chaining
Area before it is even officially open.  There is already an adopt
a trail agreement for this area with the Colorado Rock Hoppers Club
and the club is working to keep the trail open.</p>
<p>
So what can you do about it?  Two things:

<ol>
<li>
The comment period has been extended to 9/18 and the BLM is accepting
<a href="mailto:LDeike@sc.blm.gov KBerger@sc.blm.gov dkossnar@sc.blm.gov">email comments</a>.
A sample letter written by Scott Reibel is below, Scott
has been working closely with the BLM on this issue.  Please be
civil.</li>
<li>
Attend the Resource Advisory Committee meeting Thursday September 17th
to help defend this project.  For those who want to attend the RAC
meeting at the Canon City BLM office and starts at 9:00 a.m.

Subject Penrose Chaining Area

As a responsible four wheel drive recreationist, I have respected
your 1997 decision on the closure of the Badger Creek / Bloody Gulch
area to motorized vehicles. I appreciate that you are working with
the local motorized groups to develop an alternative area that
represents the same level of motorized challenge found in the Badger
Creek area.

By developing a managed motorized recreation system, you will help to
reduce the number of unauthorized, and incorrectly routed, 4WD roads on
the public lands you manage for me. With the assistance of the local 4WD
clubs, no budgetary expenses should be needed to manage the area for
motorized use, plus, other issues like access road maintenance and
trash cleanup form the surrounding areas can be accomplished.

Please reconsider your decision to open only a limited 0.4 miles of
challenging 4WD road. Though I understand your hesitation in
developing a motorized recreation system, due to the environmental
communities disdain for any public use of public lands. I recommend
that you use the original proposed action and open 2.8 to 4.0 miles
of 4WD road which will allow a more dispersed, and less concentrated
use of the Penrose OHV area.

Thank you for letting me help manage my public lands.

Sincerely,

{your name and address}

The following are potential additions to the letter from
Scott.

<ol>
<li>
Rattler was closed 1 year ago and BLM has been promising to
find us another area ever since.

<li>
I live and work in Colorado and would rather 4 wheel here.

<li>
The bottom of the canyon is bedrock.  There would be little
impact by my driving there.

<li>
If not here ...where?

<li>
Every time we work within the system, the trails are closed
or almost closed (0.4 mile). Why should we work within the system?

<li>
Isn't this an open OHV area?

<li>
We're happy to go some where else.  Where would that be?
(Not sure I would use this one as many managers assume some
other area should have to deal with motorized. Don't give them the
opportunity.[Adam])

<li>
This is an opportunity for the 4 wheeling community and the
BLM to work together.  We're ready to develop a working relationship.

<li>
Can we lease the land for 26 cents an acre?
(Relates to grazing permit holders requirements.[Adam])

<li>
Are other user groups treated this way?

<li>
What kind of bond do the moss rock gathers have to post?

<li>
Can you think of a better area for us to use?

<li>
Is this another NIMBY (not in my back yard) situation or
is it the Sierra Club?

<li>
I love the great outdoors as much as anyone.  Please let
me drive it.

<lI>
The money that would be brought into Penrose by the four
wheeling community should be considered.

<li>
Do you really think trucks bring more noxious weeds than
cattle, horses or the winds?

<li>
Give us a chance.

<li>
When was the last time the range specialists picked up
trash in that area? Bet we did it first.
</ol>
