<p>
Royal Gorge district of the BLM has released their decision on the
Penrose OHV area extreme 4WD road development project proposed by one of
the clubs of the Colorado Association of 4WD Clubs. The preferred
alternative has been modified from 0.4 miles of 4WD road development
to 1.3 miles. This increase is due to the letters of support sent in
to date for this type of project. </p>
<p>
The decision by the Colorado RockHoppers 4WD Club is to accept the 1.3
miles of extreme 4WD road development in the Penrose area. They will
begin working on this with the Royal Gorge BLM as soon as the comment
period is over (Nov.  6th).  A reduced amount of volunteer activity
on the surrounding area will be their response to the reduced mileage
in the final decision. If more mileage is developed after the initial
12 months of monitoring, work on the access road to the Penrose area
and other volunteer projects will be entertained.</p>
<p>
We will need to support this decision in order to offset the inevitable
complaints from the local, and possibly national environmental groups
and activists.  The decision allows for a request of further review
prior to November 6th, 1998. If a person or group is opposed to this
decision they can request this further review, but must state the
reasons why. Further review will delay implementation, and could
change the decision.</p>
<p>
Send your comments, before November 6th, in support of the decision to:
<pre>
Donnie Sparks, District Manager
Royal Gorge Resource Area 
3170 East Main Street
Canon City, CO  81212
</pre>
Reference the Decision Record for the EA titled "Penrose Off-Highway
Vehicle Trails Authorization" (CO-057-98-126EA).</p>
<p>
Thanks for your support of Scott Riebel's, Jerry Panek's, and the
Colorado RockHoppers 4WD Club's efforts to develop the Penrose OHV
Area.</p>
