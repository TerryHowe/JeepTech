There were a lot of changes at this years Southwest 4 Wheel Drive
Associations Winter Meeting in Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The
association was told only a few months before the event that the
BLM was shutting down hundreds of acres of land  which meant
the runs that were planned for the area would have to be moved.
The closure put an end to the infamous "Wolf Run" and "Guardian".
The clubs in the area worked hard to develop new trails that could
match the difficulty of the trails that were closed.
Without a doubt, they succeeded.

### Trail Closures
