<p>
It was a chilly morning as we met at the South Gate parking lot.
Discussions of the Super Bowl taking place the next day, four wheeling,
and tails of who shot John were plentiful as we went through the ritual
of greeting all new arrivals and waiting on folks to get ready for our
trek south.  We departed a respectful half hour late, around 8:30 a.m.,
being led by yours truly as co-pilot for Curtis.  Yes, Muddancer was
without his trusty mount (still playing transfer case games).
</p>

<p>
Those folks in attendance were - Curtis and myself, Chris Long, Dave
and Kelly Nothstein, Terry Howe, Jim Hope and son with friend, Bill
Dixon, Matt Peterson, Roger Wild and Linda with her two daughters Robin
and Erin.  Guests in attendance where Peka Aalto, Ed Magoffin, and
R.J. Robinson.
</p>

<p>
We arrived at the Mad Dog trail head, aired down, locked ‘em  in,
moved out to conquer.  First up to conquer was 4HOOFIN Bronco ridden
by Curtis.  Complete with newly installed T-18, he hardly spun a wheel,
making it look easy.  Next came Dave in his Jeep Cherokee.  At the
second obstacle, the Mad Dog awoke and took a bite out of the rear drive
shaft leaving a helpless Jeep to suffer its pain and humiliation.
After drive shaft removal, Curtis attempted to winch the injured Jeep
to level ground.  One winch proved not enough and had to be joined by
a second.  After much time and effort, the task was completed and the
conquering continued.  The Mad Dog seemed content with one Jeep, until
Terry woke it up again trying to get over the upper wall.  Again the
Mad Dog raised its ugly head and bit a Jeep.  This time it was the rear
axle of the tasty CJ-7.  After much work by all, both axles were
removed, the third member dropped, and a spare axle replaced the
bitten one.
</p>

<p>
A short trail was made long by the Mad Dog.  As we limped away, vowing
to return another day to conquer this nasty cur, we could hear a deep
growl that sounded like a sadistic chuckle daring us to try.
</p>

<p>
We returned home just after dark, secure in the knowledge that a good
time was had by all, even with the mishaps of the day.  After all, we
were able to commune with nature and challenge another of her beasts
instead of sitting at home or working.
