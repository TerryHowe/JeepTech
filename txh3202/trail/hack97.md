# Trail Report: Hackett Gulch
![Terry](hack1.jpg)
Eric Resko was kind enough to take this shot of me catching some
big air on Hackett Gulch.  After the picture Eric was kind enough
to strap me over this rock.  I've done this obstacle a couple times
in the past, but this was the frist time I'd done it with 30 lbs
of pressure in my tires.  It's a lot easier with 12 lbs or so.

From behind you can see Diane in the passenger seat wondering
why she decided to come out with me on this trail.
This was the second time Eric and I ran Hackett this summer.
The last time Eric broke the yoke on his rear axle and threw
his drive shaft.  He escaped with no damage on this trip.
