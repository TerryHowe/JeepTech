<h2>Locker and R&amp;P Upgrades</h2>
<p>
Many Jeeps come with high (numerically low) ring and pinion ratios from
the factory.  A Jeep that cannot crawl soon becomes a broken Jeep because
the driver does not have sufficient control to go over difficult obstacles.
Changing out the ring and pinion and possibly installing a locker could be
the answer</p>
