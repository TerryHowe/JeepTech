# Jeep Axle Swaps: Rear Dana 44
[![Rear Dana 44 ](/axle/d44_71_.jpg)](/axle/d44_71.jpg)
The Dana 44 is a very common axle and so it is often the least
expensive axle to swap into most small Jeeps.  Full size Jeeps
normally come with Dana 44s or larger axles.  The Dana 44 has
been used in nearly every model of Jeep at one time or another,
but not all of us are fortunate enough to have one.  Many early
Jeeps came with a Dana 44, but it use 2 piece shafts which are
fairly weak.
The Dana 44 is an excellent choice of axle for CJs, XJs, YJs,
MJs, ZJs, and TJs.  In these relatively light vehicles the
30 spline Dana 44 with one piece shafts will hold up well to
hard use.  The Dana 44 doesn't compromise clearance and there
are 44s that have compatible or close wheel bolt patterns.
The source of Dana 44 that you swap in would depend on:
- model of Jeep
- desired track width
- desired wheel bolt pattern
- what you find ant what price
### '45-'71 CJs
The CJs built from '45-'70.5 used either a Spicer 23, Dana 41,
or Dana 44 with two piece shafts.  The Dana 44 with two piece
shafts would be an upgrade from the Spicer 23 or Dana 41.  This
is a common upgrade for early CJs and MBs.
The CJ-5s and CJ-6s built from '70.5-'71 used an offset Dana 44
with 30 spline one piece shafts.  This axle is an excellent upgrade
for any CJ built during this time period.
Another inexpensive and easy Dana 44 for early CJs is the '72-'75
Dana 44.  The advantage of this 30 spline 1 piece shaft Dana 44
is the spring perches are in the correct location and this axle
is fairly easy to find.  The disadvantage is this axle has a
centered input and the Dana 18 uses an offset output.  The
rear drive shaft can be run at an unnatural angle or another
transfer case can be swapped in.

### '72-'75 CJs
One of the great things about '72-'75 CJ-5s and CJ-6s is they
come with a 30 spline Dana 44 with one piece shafts from the
factory.  People with these Jeeps can focus their money and
work in other areas such as a transmission or transfer case with
a lower low range.
### '76-'86 CJs
Most '76-'86 CJs came with the AMC 20 rear end that has two piece
shafts.  There are some exceptions where a Dana 44 with 30 spline
1 piece shafts was used.  The AMC 20 has slightly larger R&P, but
the housing is weaker and the two piece shafts are weaker than
the Dana 44.
A narrow options (narrow track width) is the Commando Dana 44
used from '72-'73.  This axle bolts right in and has the 30 spline
1 piece shafts.  It is not as wide as '82-'86 AMC 20s.
Some late '86 CJ-7s used a wide track Dana 44 with 30 spline
shafts and one piece alxes.  This is an excellent option for
any CJ built during this time.
Another option is the Dana 44 used in the rear of the Scout.  This
axle is a bit wider than stock (~58") and the spring perches need
to be moved.
Yet another fairly common option is the Dana 44 used in Wagoneers
and Cherokees in the 70s.  Disadvantage of this axle is it uses
a 6 on 5.5" wheel bolt pattern.  Either the shafts need to be
redrilled for the 5 on 5.5" wheel bolt pattern or the front
axle converted to the 6 on 5.5" wheel bolt pattern.  Another
disadvantage of this axle over the Commando and Scout rear is the
shafts on most are different lengths.   On the Commando and Scout
44s both shafts are the same length, so only one spare needs to
be carried.
Dana 44s can also be swapped in from 1/2 ton pickups, but these
tend to be on the wide side.  Depending on your use, this may be
a good option, but if you are going wide, why not use a Dana 60?
### '84- XJs
Some XJs with the heavy duty towing package came with a Dana 44.
This axle is hard to find, but it is a great low buck Dana 44 for
XJs that are not fortunate enough to have it.
### '87-'95 YJs
The Wrangler YJ never had a Dana 44 from the factory except in
Canada.  In the US, it always came with the Dana 35c.  Since
the YJ uses the smal 5 on 4.5" wheel bolt pattern, swap options
are much more limited if the wheel bolt pattern is to be
retained.
One of the only options that retains the small wheel bolt pattern
is the Dana 44 used in some heavy duty MJs and XJs.  The metric
ton MJ used a Dana 44 and some XJs with the towing package used
the Dana 44.  It is not a bolt in though because the XJs and MJs
are spring over in the rear.  The spring perches will have to be
moved.  This axle is also difficult to find.
If you are not concerned about wheel bolt pattern, it might be
a good time to upgrade to the 5 on 5.5" wheel bolt pattern.  The
larger wheel bolt pattern allows the use of a good sized hub on
the front axle.  The Scout and Wagoneer axles make good swap fodder
for YJs.  Both axles are slightly narrower than the YJ axles, since
a new wheel bolt pattern is being used, you won't be using the stock
YJ rims.  Wheels with a more conventional offset will maintain the
track width of the Wrangler.
### '93- ZJs
Some ZJs come from the factory with a Dana 44, unfortunately this
44 is not a normal 44.  It has an aluminum center piece and c-clip
shafts which make it weak.  It also has limited locker selections
since the carrier is not a normal 44 carrier.  Generally, the off-roader
would be better off with the stock Dana 35c than this unit.  There
is no real junk yard 44 for the ZJ, just about anything would require
a large amount of fabrication
### '97- TJs
The TJ has an optional Dana 44, make sure you order that option.
The down side of this 44 is it uses the small 5 on 4.5" wheel
bolt pattern.  Like the ZJ, there are no junk yard solutions
to TJ owners that do not have a 44 from the factory, a large
amount of fabrication is required to put other 44s into a TJ.

|  | [Scout Dana 44s under a YJ](/convaxle/ihscout/):
When evaluated as a hard-core off-road vehicle, the Jeep YJ is
often praised for its excellent fuel-injected motor and panned for
its weak axles and low, limited-articulation suspension.  This
is nothing a spring over with Scout Dana 44s won't cure. |
