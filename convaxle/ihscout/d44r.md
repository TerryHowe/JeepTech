# Swapping a Scout II Dana 44 Rear into a YJ
[![Rear under carriage view]()]()

In comparison, it was much easier to prepare the rear axle
housing than the front.  As with the front, I completely
disassembled it and steam cleaned it.  New bearings & seals
were purchased, as were new brakes and drums.
### Spring Perches
[![Adjustable perches]()]()
The old spring perches were ground off with a angle grinder and
new spring perches for the rear were purchased from Lou
Feger's Racing.  They were of a clamp-on design which allowed me to
mount the axle to the my Jeep without welding the perches in place.
This allowed me to adjust the pinion angle once the Jeep was resting
on the wheels rather than trying to calculate/guesstimate what the
pinion angle should be.  I also had the option of adjusting the pinion
angle after taking it for a few test drives.
With the Jeep sitting on all fours, I used a
scissor jack to adjust the pinion so that it was just a few
degrees shy of pointing directly at the rear xfer case
output shaft.
### Shock Mounts

Lower shock mounts were similar to the front except that the
studs ran parallel to the tube.  They were mounted in line with the
tube to maximize ground clearance.
### Brakes
With my spring over axle conversion, the parking brake cable worked
with the Scout brakes but it was a bit short when the axle was at
full droop.  The YJ brake hose junction block is on the driver's
side, opposite to the Scout layout.  I tried moving the YJ's hard
brake lines onto the D44 housing, but as I expected, one of the
lines was seized.  I had to make a new hard line for the passenger
side.
I welded a bolt onto the top of the driver's side tube
to mount the YJ's junction block (T-block) onto the D44 axle
housing.  I slipped the block over the bolt and secured it
in place with a nut.
### Conclusion
That wasn't too painful, was it?
