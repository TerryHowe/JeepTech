The passenger side is easier since there is only a spring perch.
I used some 1/2 inch thick steel plate and welded in next to the
the inner part of the spring perch.  The nice part about this
swap is it is not necessary to cut off the spring perch and
remount it.  The king pin also gets redrilled 1/2" to the inside,
measure twice and drill once.
</p>

<H4>U-Bolts</H4>
<p>
Make sure you use rod for cast material when you weld the perch
widening pieces.  You also will need to grind at each spring perch to
clear the Ubolts, and drill a hole trough differential webbing on the
inside U-bolt for the U-bolt to go through.  You will need to get
larger U-bolts for the drivers side because the U-bolts run over
the cast iron section use SJ U-bolts or have your local spring
shop make you some.  The SJ U-bolt plates can be used for the swap
since the U-bolt size is different from the Dana 30 U-bolts, but
the spring width is the same.

<H4>Sway Bar, Track Bar, and Shocks</h4>
<p>
The SJ U-bolt plates are handy because they have the sway bar pins
on them, and your sway bar will match up perfectly when you use
these. The original SJ shock mounts brackets on the D44 work with
the Wrangler shocks.</p>

<H4>Steering</H4>
<P>
The stock YJ pitman arm is retained.  The steering linkage will
match up fine if you have the pitman arm machined (conical hole)
to fit the SJ drag link.  Because the tie rod is on top of the
knuckles on the D44, a drop pitman arm is not used and the tie
rod is more up out of the way.</p>

<H4>Front Drive Shaft</H4>
<p>
<a href="d44-5.jpg"><IMG SRC="d44-5_.jpg" ALT="Front drive shaft" ALIGN="right" HEIGHT="129" WIDTH="200"></a>
Since I had a shackle reversal, I had a custom front drive shaft
with extra up-travel built.  Another guy, Kerry, who did this
swap without doing the shackle reversal said that the front
driveshaft from a 2.5L AX5 YJ is the perfect length - it's
about an inch shorter than the 4.0L AX15 driveshaft.  Depending
on your suspension you may not need drive shaft modifications.</p>

<H4>Brakes</H4>
<P>
I used all the brakes hardware from the SJ the axle, but the lines
on my YJ were not compatible.  Stainless lines for a CJ worked had
the right ends though and the bolted right in place of my old YJ
brake hose.  It took longer to throw new pads then to replace the
lines.  The YJ master cylinder works well enough, but it has
more travele and they are harder to bleed. I'm running my stock
master cylinder until I can find a bolt-in replacement with a
larger bore.</p>

<H3>Swapping in the rear axle:</H3>
<P>
The rear axle is simple, remove the old spring perches and weld the
new ones on.  I obtained some inexpensive Confer perches from my
local 4x4 shop.  One can also use adjustable perches, but these are
cheaper.  With the Jeep raised, I installed the axle sitting loosely
on the spring perches and loosely bolted to the springs.  I made sure
the axle was centered by measuring from the axle end to the outside
edge of the spring. When the numbers matched, I set the pinion angle
and welded it up.  If you are using a CV style drive shaft, point the
pinion just below the center of the output on the transfercase.  One
can use special tools, but My eyeball job worked well.  I haven't
had any drive line vibration and you could use shims to fine-tune it
if there is a problem.</p>

<h4>Shocks</h4>
<p>
I removed the original shock mounts from the Dana 35c axle and welded
them onto the D44 tubes.  This works well or I could have bought some
generic shock mounts and welded them on.</p>

<h4>U-Bolts</h4>
<p>
I will be flipping my rear U-bolts using Toyota Spring plates and
square U-bolts.   For now, I used the Scout U-bolt plates and Scout
size U-bolts.</p>

<h4>Brakes</h4>
<p>
I used the YJ hard lines and brake hose on the Scout II axle. The
side which the hard-line drops from the frame rail to the axle is
opposite from the Scout, so a hole was drilled and tapped on the
correct side of the axle tube.  The YJ hard-line on the D44 axle
threaded into the wheel cylinders. The Dana 35c emergency brake
cables were used.</p>

<h4>Rear Drive Shaft</h4>
<P>
<a href="atlas-12.jpg"><IMG SRC="atlas-12_.jpg" ALT="Rear drive shaft" width=200 HEIGHT="117" align=right></a>
Since I installed an Atlas transfercase at the same time, I had a
rear CV type driveshaft custom made.  If you were to keep the NP231
transfer case, it all depends on what year YJ you have.  Some Wranglers
use the same size U-joint as the Scout and some use a different size.
I'm unsure when the change occured.</p>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>	
<p>
I have a 4 inch Rubicon Express lift with the UpWarrior shackle
reversal.  I have no wander, bump steer, or tire wear that I have
noticed.  I left out the trac bar and have had no problems.
Other things need to be considered when making the swap such as
gearing, wheels, oil, and all the other odds and ends.</p>
<p>
Please keep in mind that the opinions expressed are my own.  I
also would like to warn the reader that an axle swap is not as
easy a bolting on nerf bars.  This task requires fabrication
and welding skills, a good eye, time and money. What else you
incorporate into the swap also affects all these factors.  I
am simply providing information regarding my experiences while
swapping the axles.</p>
