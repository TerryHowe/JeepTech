Who in their right mind would take a perfectly functional 9-year-old
Jeep YJ, rip out the entire undercarriage, and replace it with
parts from a 25-year old Ford?  Chances are if you're reading this
then you understand already, but for those of you who don't...
<UL>
<LI>
Stock YJ axles are a relatively weak link in an otherwise excellent
vehicle.  If you want to run tires over 31", especially with lockers,
then the odds of breaking an axle shaft or u-joint, or even bending
a housing, go way up under even moderate usage.</LI>

<LI>
The early Broncos, on the other hand, were big, heavy, and thus very
solidly built. The stock axles for a 1973 EB were a standard-cut Dana 44
up front and the much-praised Ford 9" in the back. In a YJ they make
for a very stout combination and reduce the odds of breakage even with
large tires and lockers.</li>

<LI>
The brakes are bigger all around (I've
ended up with 11" discs and 11" drums). The axles are about four
inches wider than on the YJ, which is nice for a little extra stability
too.</LI>

<LI>
It was a cool project. Early on in the game I discovered that I couldn't
find anyone who had ever done this swap before, so from then on it
became a personal challenge. Something about the risk involved appealed
to the fool within me. That and I had no idea what I was really getting
into. My most ambitious project before this was an on-board air system
(not even in the same ballpark) and while I'm mechanically inclined this
was way beyond anything I'd ever done before.</LI>

<h3>How did it start?</H3>
<p>
Before the swap, My Jeep was a relatively stock 1989 YJ. It had 2.5"
OME lift springs in it and 31" AT tires, and that was as far as I
thought I wanted to go with lift. Then Larry Soo (aka lars) got
involved. I remember one conversation:

<P>Larry : "You should do a springover. Hmm... springover with OME
springs."
<BR>Me: "Uh, yeah, right. Heh heh."

<P>
But the seed was planted. I'd wanted to get a rear locker for
a while, but didn't like the idea of throwing $$ at the stock D30 and
D35 axles after hearing them bashed so often on the Jeep-L and
Jeeptech lists.</p>
<p>
Some time later, Larry told me about a friend of a
friend who was selling a pair of axles from an old Bronco. I went over
to see them. They looked terrible!  Covered in rust and some kind of
green mildew, but the potential was there! The rear end had the stock
28-spline axles, and the front had a standard-cut diff and drum brakes,
but the width looked good and they had 4.10 gears in them.
Next thing I know, I've purchased the axles and I'm planning a
spring over axle conversion.</p>

The early Bronco Dana 44 had 30 spline shafts, 8.5&quot; ring

end in a Wrangler or CJ.
