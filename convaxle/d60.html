Some Jeep "heavy" 1/2 ton pickups used a semi-floating Dana 60
with a 5 on 5 1/2" wheel bolt pattern.  The standard 1/2 ton pickups
used a Dana 44 and the 3/4 ton pickups used a full floating Dana 60
with different wheel bolt pattern.  This axle makes a great low
buck Dana 60 option since the wheel bolt pattern matches the normal
CJ wheel bolt pattern.  These axles are wide for a CJ, but the tubes
can be cut and rewelded and the shafts cut and resplined.  The
axle in the photograph is from a '73 J-4000 pickup.  I've seen this
axle on J-4000s and since it was used from '73-'79, it must be
available on some J-10s as well.  This axle had 12" brakes, which
might need to be swapped out to fit in a 15" wheel.  Note the 60-2
cast on the bottom of the differential cover.  This type of axle is
probably available in some Chevy and Ford pickups.</p>
<p>
This axle was available with 4.09:1 R&P standard and optionally with
4.88:1 R&P when used behind a Dana 20 transfer case.  It was also
used with the Borg-Warner 13-39 Quadratrac transfer case with 4.09:1
R&P.  The version used with the Quadratrac probably has an offset
differential, so perhaps you could get away with only shortening
one side of this axle.</p>
