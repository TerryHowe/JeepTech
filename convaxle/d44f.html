<p>
Scout and Wagoneer front Dana 44s are good candidates for swapping into
a CJ, but shortening is required to maintain stock widths.  These axles
can also be put in uncut by moving the spring perches outside the
frame.  An article below discusses doing this with Scout axles on a
CJ.</p>
<p>
If you are going to get axles cut, wide track CJs only need
the long side shortened.  A narrow track CJ would need
both sides shortened to keep the stock width.
Pictured above is a Scout Dana 44 narrowed to narrow track
specifications on Rick's '77 CJ-7.</p>
<p>
The Scout and Wagoneer Dana 44 front axles are close enough to the
proper width for Wrangler YJs.  One spring perch needs to be moved
slightly on the Wagoneer front end.  The difficulty with the YJ
is finding knuckles that allow full steering.</p>

How to swap a Cherokee/Wagoneer Dana 44 front axle into a Wrangler
YJ.  This is probably the easiest Dana 44 front end to swap into
a Wrangler.

When evaluated as a hard-core off-road vehicle, the Jeep YJ is
often praised for its excellent fuel-injected motor and panned for
its weak axles and low, limited-articulation suspension.  This
is nothing a spring over with Scout Dana 44s won't cure.

Chris Waterman tells us how he swapped an early Bronco Ford 9"
and Dana 44 into his Wrangler YJ.  The transformation was enhanced
with a spring over axle lift at the same time.
