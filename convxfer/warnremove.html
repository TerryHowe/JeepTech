<p>
I get confused everytime I remove a Warn (aka Saturn) over drive from
a Dana 18 transfer case that was in a Jeep or Scout 80.  Looking at the
exploded view from Advanced Adapters helps, but sometimes I still
get it wrong and I have to figure it out all over again.  I figured
if I wrote up the procedure, I wouldn't forget again and at least
I'd have something to look up.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Remove the five bolts that run through the case of the over drive
with a 9/16" socket.
</li>
<li>
Pry the over drive case away from the Dana 18 case.  Keep in
mind that the gasket sealer and the bearing that rides in the
plenetary hub assembly may fight a bit.
</li>
<li>
Remove special snap ring that is behind  and can be seen through the
planetaries.
</li>
<li>
Remove the special lock washer that is behind the snap ring with
some needle nose pliers.
</li>
<li>
Use long 1/2" extension to remove planetary hub assembly from
transmission output shaft.
</li>
</ul>
