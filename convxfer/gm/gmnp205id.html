<p>
The NP205 transfer case is a heavy duty gear driven transfer case in a
cast iron case.  The low range is 1.98:1 and it was used from 1971
until 1980 in Blazers and full size pickups.  The transfer case has
a poor low range, but may be useful in situations where strength
is more important than crawl ratio.</p>
<p>
Some versions of the NP205 are drivers drop and some versions are
passenger drop.  There are variations in input spline count.
