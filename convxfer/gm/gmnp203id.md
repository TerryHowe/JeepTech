# GM NP203

#### by [Terry L. Howe](mailto:txh3202@worldnet.att.net)

The NP203 transfer case is a chain driven transfer case in a
cast iron case used.  It is a heavy duty case with a 2:00:1
low range with a set of differentials for full time use.
It was used from 1971 until 1980 in various Chevy pickups.
Due to it's poor low range, weight, and size, it is not suitable
for swap into most Jeep vehicles.
