# GM NP241
<H4>by [Terry L. Howe](mailto:txh3202@worldnet.att.net)</H4>
The NP241 transfer case is a chain driven transfer case in an
aluminum case used in 1988+ Chevy and GMC trucks.  The GM version
comes in drivers and passenger drop versions.  The K series trucks
use a drivers drop version.  This transfer case is also used in
Dodge trucks and Ramchargers after 1988.
A neat thing about the GM NP241 is the input shaft can be swapped
into a Jeep NP231 for a low buck 700R4 adapter.  The GM NP241 uses
a different spline count than the Jeep NP231, but that is reported
to be the only difference.
