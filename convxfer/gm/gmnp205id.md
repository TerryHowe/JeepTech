The NP205 transfer case is a heavy duty gear driven transfer case in a
cast iron case.  The low range is 1.98:1 and it was used from 1971
until 1980 in Blazers and full size pickups.  The transfer case has
a poor low range, but may be useful in situations where strength
is more important than crawl ratio.
Some versions of the NP205 are drivers drop and some versions are
passenger drop.  There are variations in input spline count.
