The Saturn Overdrive (originally produced by Warn)
is a bolt on 0.75:1 overdrive for Jeeps equipped with the
Dana 18 transfer case.  It bolts on the PTO port on the Dana
18 and it works in all forward and reverse gears.  There is
a PTO adapter available for the Warn Overdrive that will allow
you to bolt a PTO output to the back of the overdrive.  Advanced
Adapters lists the part, but has never produced it.  It can be
found used.

Talking with Paul Weitlauf, I realized there were more differences
between the overdrives than I originally thought.  I have a small
hole Warn Overdrive on my CJ-2A and Paul has a big hole Warn Overdrive
on his CJ-5.  On his overdirve, the shift rail comes out the back
of the case and on mine the shift rail comes out the front of the
case.

I double checked the Advanced Adapters catalog and they show
an overdrive with the shift rail coming out the back of the case.
I'm not sure if all the new Saturn Overdrives have the shift rail
out the back or only the big hole untis.  A picture of Paul's
overdrive is on the right.

Probably the most frequently asked question about the Warn/Saturn
overdrive is, "How do I remove the overdrive?"  Here are some
instructions on [
how to remove](/convxfer/warnremove.html) it.
