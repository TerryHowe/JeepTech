International Harvester truck fans are big into line setting tickets.
A line setting ticket identifies all the parts that were used to build
the original truck.  The line setting ticket uses special IH codes to
identify these parts and this table has been compiled to cross
reference those codes with the manufactures model number.  If you
purchase an IH truck it may come with a line setting ticket or you
could still purchase the line setting ticket for your truck.  The
line setting ticket may still be in the glove box or behind the
glove box.
