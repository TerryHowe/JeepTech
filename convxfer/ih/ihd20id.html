<p>
The Dana 20 transfer case used in IH Scouts and trucks is bolt
compatible with most Jeep trucks.  The Scout 800 used the Dana 20
from mid 60s when it was introduced until 1972.  The Scout II and
related models used the Dana 20 from 1972 until 1979.  The only
real difference between the versions used in the Jeep and the
Scout is the shift linkage.  A neat part about the Dana 20 used
in some early Scout 800s is it came from the factory with a twin
stick shifter.</p>
