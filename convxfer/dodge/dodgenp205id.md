# Dodge NP205

#### by [Terry L. Howe](mailto:txh3202@worldnet.att.net)

The NP205 transfer case is a heavy duty gear driven transfer case in a
cast iron case.  The low range is 1.98:1 and it was used from 1971
until 1980 in Dodge trucks.  The transfer case has
a poor low range, but may be useful in situations where strength
is more important than crawl ratio.

The NP205 is still used in some heavy duty Dodge trucks.  Some versions
of the NP205 are drivers drop and some are passenger drop.  There
are variations in input spline count and some NP205s are divorce
mounted.
