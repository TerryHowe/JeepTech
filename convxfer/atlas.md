The Atlas transfer case
is a new development from Advanced Adapters.  It is gear driven with
an aluminum case.  The internals are similar to a Dana 300 except
it has a low range reduction of 3.7:1 and lower.  They have
version for the Wrangler and should have versions for
earlier CJs available at this time.
