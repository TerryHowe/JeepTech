<p>
The SM420 is the older heavy duty, granny, 4 speed transmission used in
Chevy and GM trucks.  The large cast iron case with large bulge on the
passenger side makes it easy to identify.</p>
<p>
It is an excellent 4 speed to swap into a Jeep with a Chevy or Buick
engine.  It will work well with any GM engine because it uses a standard
GM size input bearing retainer, so getting a bell housing for it should
be easy.</p>
<p>
Another advantage of the SM420 is it's length is the shortest of all
the heavy duty 4 speeds.  When you add the adapter, the Jeep T-18 is
shorter, but the SM420 is shorter than other adapted granny
trannies.</p>
<p>
The SM420 only had a backup light switch in 1967.  Earlier versions
of the SM420 did not have this feature which many would take for
granted today.  The ribbing was only available on late cases and
some grinding of the ribbing is required if it is to be used with
a Dana 20 or Dana 18.  The same is probably true if the ribbed case
is used with a Dana 300.  The ribbed SM420 case should not be confused
with the later SM465 transmission.</p>

Note the ribbed side of the case.  Early cases do not have this
ribbing.

case attached.  You can just make out the backup light switch to
the right and back of the transmission shift lever.  The switch is
partially obscured by the transfer case shift levers.

All SM420s have a casting on the drivers side.  The numbers seem
to vary from transmission to transmission, but every one I've seen
has "GM" and the large number starts with a "5".  Most likely
the "E43" in this casting is a date code.  The screw heads are
part of the casting.</p>
