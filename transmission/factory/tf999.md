The Torque Flite 999 is a medium duty Chrysler 3 speed automatic transmissions. They have an aluminum case and a 23 spline output shaft. The case is ??\" long and ?? bolts hold in the pan.

Modern versions are still use the 23 spline output, but engine bolt patterns have changed and the newer ones have electronic shift control. I have conflicting information about torque converters. Some say early models did not have a lock up torque converter and some say they did. Newer models have a lock up torque converter.

### Usage

The TF 999 was used in CJs from 1980-1986 only with the I6 and V8 engine. It was also used in 1984-1990 SJs and J pickups with the 4.2L engine, in the YJ from 1987-1991 with the 2.5L and 4.2L engine, and in the XJ in 1991 with the 2.5L engine. A modern version of the 999 continues to be used in Wrangler YJs and TJs to this day with the I6 engine.
