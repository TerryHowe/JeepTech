# Jeep Engine: AMC 258 I6
[![258 I6](258T.jpg)](258.jpg)
The AMC 258 was introduced in 1971 in J-series pickups and Wagoneers
and in 1972 in CJs.  It continued to be used through 1990 in the
Wrangler.  It is basically a stroked 232 engine.  The great thing
about this engine is it reliable, inexpensive, and has horse power
and toque peaks at low RPM.
The 258 inline 6 (I6) engine always came from the factory carbureted
any many people complain about the Carter BBD carburetor and the maze
of emmissions vacuum hoses.  There are a couple articles below that
can help you sort through those hoses and tune the Carter BBD.  For
a carbureted engine, the 258 with the Carter BBD performs very well
off road.  The 258 always came with a cast iron block and cylinder
head, hydraulic lifters (with non-adjustable rockers), and 7 main
bearings.
The 258 used in '87-'90 Wrangler YJs uses a computer controlled
Carter BBD.  It is very simlar to the 258 used in '82-'86 CJs,
but performance suffers due to emmission controls.
