# Jeep Engine: GM 151
[![151 pasenger side](/images/engine/gm1511_.jpg)](/images/engine/gm1511.jpg)
The 151 (2.5L) inline 4 engine was used in '80-'83 CJs
including the CJ-8, CJ-7, and CJ-5.  The 151 is often called
the "Iron Duke", but is actually a Pontiac engine designed to
replace the Chevy "Iron Duke" I4 engine.  The engine does have
the Chevy bell housing bolt pattern though.  The engine is manufactured
by GM and uses a cast iron block and cylinder
head with hydraulic lifters and 5 main bearings.  The 151 cetainly is
not a screamer, the AMC I4 has much better HP and torque ratings.
The neat part about the engine is it has the same bell housing bolt
pattern as a Chevy small block.  The bell housing makes a great low
buck Ford/Jeep to Chevy adapter since it is basically Ford on the
transmission side and Chevy on the engine side.  A regular Chevy
bell housing will bolt to the 151, so if you plan a transmission
swap, a Chevy transmission would be the way to go.  Also, a Chevy
305 or 350 will bolt right to the Iron duke bell housing.  The down
side of dropping in a V8 is most transmissions used with the Iron
Duke are light weight units.
The GM 151 has the intake and exhaust manifolds on
opposite sides of the cylinder head, but the AMC 150
has the intake and exhaust manifolds on the same side of the
cylinder head.  The picture at the top of the page is the
passenger side with the intake manifold and carb.  The drivers
side is pictured below with the exhaust manifold removed.
