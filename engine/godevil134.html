<p>
The power and torque of the L-Head engine is arguably the main
reason Willys won the contract with the DOD to produce the MB
used in WWII.  It doesn't seem like much by todays standards, but
it out performed the engines used in the Ford and Bantam prototypes.
The MB used a different carburetor from the civilian models and
currently I do not have the percise specs on it, but it is right in this
same range.</p>
<p>
The L-Head is known as the L-Head becase the valves for the exhaust
and intake are in the block.  Most engines used in automobiles today
have valves in the head.  This design gave it the
advantage of having a relatively low profile.  Part of the DOD
specifications required the vehicle to be able to drive under
an object that was about 3 feet high.</p>
<p>
The L-Head engines uses a cast iron block and cylinder head with
3 main bearings and mechanical lifters.  The "Go Devil" engine
earned its fame in the MB use in WWII.
The L-Head continued to be used in the post War CJ-2A, Willys Wagon,
Willys Pickup, CJ-3A, M38, and DJ-3A.  The specifications are slightly
different presumably due to carburetor and compression differences
between the engines.  The L-Head used in '45-'50 CJ-2As and '49-'50
CJ-3As is rated the same.</p>

The L-Head used in 1947 until mid 1950 Willys Pickups and Willys
Wagons has a slightly higher torque rating.  It uses a different
carburetor and has different compression.</p>
