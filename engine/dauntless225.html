<!-- All about the Jeep Dauntless Buick 225 V6 engine. -->


<!-- END HEADER -->


<p>
The "Dauntless" 225 V6 engine was introduced in 1966 in the CJ
and C101 models.  The V6 configuration of the engine makes it
very compact which is a big plus in tight Jeep engine
compartments.  Kaiser purchased the tooling to build the 225
from Buick and later, AMC sold the tooling back to Buick.</p>
<p>
A desendent of this engine, the 231 (3.8L) V6,  is used in GM
cars to this day.  The modernized and common 231 is a good canidate
for replacing a blown 225.  There are differences in the balancing
of the engine though, so it can be tricky.  The 225 is externally
balanced and the 231 is internally balanced.  This means you cannot
just throw your 225 fly wheel on a 231, the 231 must be balanced.</p>
<p>
The flywheel itself used with the 225 is not typical.  The flywheels
used in the Jeep vehicles are very thick and heavy to increase torque.
The flywheels used in Buick cars are much lighter.</p>
<p>
Since the 225 is a Buick engine, it uses the standard Buick
bell housing.  The standard Buick bell housing will bolt to
a SM420, so this is probably the best transmission swap option
for Jeeps equipped with this engine.  The T-14 and T-86 3
speed transmissions used behind this engine are not known for
their strength.</p>
<p>
The Buick 225 uses a cast iron block and cylinder heads with
mechanical lifters and 3 main bearings.</p>
