# Jeep Engine: Vigilante AMC 327 V8
The "Vigilante" AMC 327 V8 has a cast iron block and cylinder head
with overhead valves and hydraulic lifters.  The Vigilante was built
by AMC and is not the popular Chevy 327 V8.  The AMC 327 was used in
Jeep full size trucks and Wagoneers from 1965 until 1968.  AMC did
not standardize engine bell housing bolt patterns until the early
70s, so as I understand it, the AMC 327 V8 does not have the same
bell housing bolt pattern used in later AMC engines.
