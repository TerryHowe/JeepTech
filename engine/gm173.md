# Jeep Engine: GM 173(2.8L) V6
The 2.8L V6 engine uses a cast iron block and cylinder head with
hydraulic lifters and over head valves.  It was first introduced
as an optional engine in the little Cherokee (XJ) and it was later
used in the Comanche (MJ).  The engine was built by GM and a similar
engine was used in many GM cars and trucks.
