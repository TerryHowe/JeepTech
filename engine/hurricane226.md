# Jeep Engine: Super Hurricane L-Head 226 I6

The "Super Hurricane" 226 L-Head engine has a cast iron block and
cylinder head with 4 main bearings and solid lifters.  The exhaust
and intake valves are in the block, not in the cylinder head.  The
engine was used in earlier Willys cars, but was first introduced
in 1950 in Willys trucks.  The Willys Pickup and Willys Wagon used
the 226 from '54 until '63.  There was an option 7.3:1 high altitude
version available during these years.

The 226 used between 1954-1958 has a slightly higher horse power
rating than the later 226.
