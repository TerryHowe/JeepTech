# Jeep Engine: AMC 360 V8

[![360 V8](360T.jpg)](360.jpg)

The AMC 360 was introduced in 1971 in J-series pickups and
Wagoneers.  It has a cast iron block and cylinder head with
over head valves and hydraulic lifters.

In 1971, the AMC 360 have very high rating.  I would assume
these are gross ratings and the later are net ratings.

| Horsepower (gross) | 245@4400 |
| Torque (gross) | 365@2600 |

| Fuel | 2bbl |

In 1972, the 2bbl 360 is more conservatively rated, presumably these
are net ratings.

In 1973, an optional 4bbl carburetor was available.  The horsepower
and torque ratings for this version are significantly better.
