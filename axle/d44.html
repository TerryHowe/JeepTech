<br>

<P>
Several variations of the Dana 44 have been used as the rear
axle in Jeeps, all of them use a 8.5" ring and pinion.  The
Dana 44s with the two piece shafts are 19 spline or 27 spline and
the versions wih the once piece shafts are 30 spline.</p>
<P>
The R&P ratio ranges supported by the carriers are 2.87-3.73 and
3.92-5.89.  Not all ratios are available for all the variations
of the Dana 44.</p>

<h3>CJ Dana 44</h3>
<p>
Before 1972 all CJ Dana
44s had an offset differential since the Dana 18 transfer
case has the rear output shaft offset to the passenger side.
Before mid 1970, they used a 19 spline or 27 spline, two piece axle
shaft.  After mid 1970, they used a superior 30 spline flanged axle
shaft.
<p>
The Dana 44 was introduced in the CJ line
on the CJ-3A starting with serial number #37549 (late '50).
Earlier CJ-2As and CJ3As did not use the Dana 44.
<P>
Starting in 1972, the Dana 20 transfer case was used which has
the rear output shaft centered, so the rear axle has the
differential in the center.  From 1972-1975 the Dana 44 was
used with a 30 spline flanged axle shaft.  This Dana 44 uses
11" drum brakes and the most common ratio is 3.73.
<p>

-->
After '76, the AMC 20 was the the only axle used in CJs with
two exceptions.  Some CJ-7s with the Borg-Warner Quadra-Trac
transfer case came with a 30 spline, one piece shaft, offset,
narrow track Dana 44.  The other exception is in 1986, when
CJ production was coming to a close AMC 20s
were in short supply, so they used wide track Dana 44s in
some of the '86 models.  Bolt on compatible with any '76-'86
CJ, but wider than earlier narrow tack AMC 20s.  Use of the
Dana 44 in 1986 began somewhere between serial numbers ending
with 049379 and 054173.  The axles
were flanged and 30 spline.
Common ratios were 2.73 and 3.31.
<p>
All CJ Dana 44s use a 5 on 5.5" wheel bolt pattern.</p>

<h3>XJ and MJ Dana 44</h3>
<P>
The XJ and MJ are/were available with a Dana 44 with the heavy
duty towing option or metric ton option.  I'm not sure if the XJ
always came with a Dana 44 when the towing option was ordered.
The axles will interchange between the models and use a 5 on
4.5" wheel bolt pattern.  This axle could also be a good low
buck swap for a Wrangler YJ, but the sping perches would need to
be moved.  The shafts are one piece and 30 spline.</p>

<h3>ZJ Dana 44</h3>
<P>
The ZJ Dana 44 is the only Jeep Dana 44 with an aluminum differential
housing.  It is also a C-clip axle with one piece shafts and a 5 on
4.5" wheel bolt pattern.  Because of the aluminum housing and C-clips,
it is not really any more desirable than a Dana 35c.  The shafts are
30 spline.
</p>

<h3>TJ Dana 44</h3>
<P>
One of the great things about the new TJ is it can be ordered
with a Dana 44 rear.  The Dana 44 in the TJ uses one piece
shafts with a 5 on 4.5" wheel bolt pattern.  Common ratios are
3.07 and 3.55.

<h3>Other Dana 44</h3>
<p>
The Dana 44 used in the military M38, M38A1, M170, Willys Wagon,
and Willys Pickup was the same was the version used in the CJ
vehicles during that time period.  Willys Pickup and FC trucks
had a couple others optional rear axles used with models with
higher GVW.  The Dana 44 was the light weight model for the Willys
Pickup and FC trucks.  All these Dana 44s use
a 5 on 5.5" wheel bolt pattern.</p>
<p>
The Dana 44 was standard in Wagoneers, full size Cherokees,
and J series pickups.  A wide track version was
introduced for the Cherokee and Wagoneer in the 80s.
The Cherokees and Wagoneers built from 1974 on use a 6 on 5.5"
wheel bolt pattern.  Models built before 1974 used a 5 on 5.5"
wheel bolt pattern.  Most rear ends before '74 use the weaker
2 piece shafts, but some of the later ones uses 1 piece shafts.
The early Wagoneer and Cherokees used Dana 30 and Dana 27 front
ends.</p>
<p>
The Dana 44 used in the '72-'73 Jeepster Commandos with the one
piece shafts is an excellent low buck swap from '76-'86 CJs.  It
bolts right on, has 30 spline one piece shafts, and is narrow
track width.</p>

Dana 44 rear axle from 50s Willys Wagon.  This Dana 44 uses 10
spline, two piece shafts.  You can see the caps on the end of the
shafts for the nut.  It is much wider and uses wider spring perches
than the CJ Dana 44.
