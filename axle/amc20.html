All AMC 20s have an 8 7/8" R&P and use 29 spline shafts.
The AMC 20 R&P is 3/8" bigger than the Dana 44, but
it uses smaller shafts, smaller axle tubes, and the CJ version
comes with weaker two-piece shafts.  The AMC20 uses a 29-spline shaft, where as the later Dana 44 uses a 30-spline shaft.
The AMC 20 housing tends to flex a lot, which can cause breakage.
This can be remedied by welding the tubes and/or adding gussets.
The reason the AMC 20 flexes more than the Dana 44 is the shorter
differential housing and smaller axle tubes.  Its other flaw is
the CJ version uses the two-piece axle made up of a hub and a shaft.
The hub end tends to break off under load which has created the
market for one piece AMC 20 axle shafts.  Unfortunately, the shafts
are expensive ($350+ USD) and in some cases a special bearing must
be used.

Identifying the gear ratio of an AMC 20 is a bit tricky.  Dana
axles normally have a tag on the left of the diff cover
with the gear ratio at the time of build.  The AMC axles have a
code that has to be looked up in a table.  The code is stamped on
the housing boss to the left of the diff cover right near the
axle tube.  The good part about the stamp is it tends to stay readable
longer than the tag, but you have to know the code.  Since there
are conflicts between what a code means for a narrow track and
what it means for a wide track, don't count solely on the code
to identify an axle.  Bring a tape measure or know the source of
the part.

The Trac-Lok is a limited slip differential.  You may have to
scrape away a lot of mud, paint, and rust to uncover the code.
If you can't find the code on the rear, check the tag on the
front axle.  Both axles should be geared the same.
<p>
The R&P ratio ranges supported by the carriers are 2.73 and 3.31–5.13.
The 5.13 gear ratio is not available for the Dana 30, so it
is rare to see it.  4.56s are the lowest common ratio between the
Dana 30 and AMC 20.  5.13s are available for the Dana 44.</p>

<h3>CJ AMC 20</h3>
<p>
The CJs used two versions of the AMC 20, the narrow track
from '76–'81 and the wide track from '82–'86.  Both versions use
keyed, two-piece shaft/hub design and 5 on 5.5" wheel bolt pattern.
Supplies of AMC 20s were exhausted in 1986 and some Dana 44s were
used in the last of the CJ-7s.</p>
</p>
<p>
From 1976–1978 a larger 11x2" drum brakes was used on the AMC 20.
After 1978, a 10x1.75" drum was used.</p>

</p>
<h3>SJ AMC 20</h3>
<p>
The Wagoneer and full-size Cherokee also used a narrow and wide
track version of the AMC 20.  Both SJ versions used one-piece
shafts and 6 on 5.5" wheel bolt pattern.
Since the length and bolt pattern is different from the CJ
version, the SJ shafts are not compatible without resplining
and redrilling.  I've never heard of anyone going to the
trouble.</p>
