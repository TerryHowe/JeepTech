# Jeep Axle: Dana 60
The Dana 60 is only availble on Jeeps for heavy duty applications.
It was an option semi-floating and full floating in the J-series
pickups until 1981.  Some heavy 1/2 ton and early 3/4 ton J-series
trucks used a semi-floating Dana 60 with 5 on 5.5" wheel bolt pattern.
Later 3/4 ton and 1 ton trucks used a full floating Dana 60 with 8
on 6.5" wheel bolt pattern.  Shafts are either 30 or 35 spline.
