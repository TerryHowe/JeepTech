<p>
The Dana 35 has a 7 9/16" ring and
pinion and uses one piece axles (2.625" in diameter).  Starting
in 1990 they switched to an inferior C-clip Dana 35c.  The "c" in
Dana 35c does not stand for C-clip, it stands for custom.  They
are custom because they are shipped incomplete from the Dana
factory to Chysler and Chrysler completes the build.  The two
versions have different shafts, bearings, and carrier.  There is a
C-clip elminator kit available for the Dana 35c.  The Dana 35c is
probably on the small side for hard four wheeling with larger tires
and lockers.  If these are your intentions, you might be better off
swapping in a Dana 44 or better.</p>
<p>
Early YJs built from '87 until '89 used a 10" rear drum instead of
the 9" drum used in the later YJ and TJ Dana 35c.  The axle in the
picture above has the 10" drums.</p>
<P>
The R&P ratio ranges supported by the carriers are 2.73-3.31 and
3.55-4.56.



<h3>Specs</h3>
<p>
The Dana 35c is the axle used in all YJs (Wrangler) from '87-'95 and it
is the standard axle in the TJ (Wrangler), ZJ (Grand Cherokee),
MJ (Comanche), and XJ (Cherokee).  The Dana 44
is an optional axle on the TJ, ZJ, MJ, and XJ.  Some XJs were
built with the corporate Chrysler 8.25 axle as standard.  The
TJ and ZJ versions are coil sprung, the XJ version is leaf
sprung (spring over), and the YJ and MJ versions are leaf
sprung (spring under).</p>
