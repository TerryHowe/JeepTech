[![Dana 60 diff cover](/images/axle/bwd60_.jpg)](/images/axle/bwd60.jpg)\

The Dana 60 is only available on Jeeps for heavy-duty applications. It was an option semi-floating and full floating in the J-series pickups until 1981. Some heavy 1/2-ton and early 3/4 ton J-series trucks used a semi-floating Dana 60 with 5 on 5.5\" wheel bolt pattern. Later 3/4 ton and one-ton trucks used a full floating Dana 60 with 8 on 6.5\" wheel bolt pattern. Shafts are either 30 or 35 spline.
