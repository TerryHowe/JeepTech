## Drive Train

### Engine

The original engine offered in the CJ-6 was the [\"Hurricane\" F-Head 134 I4](/engine/factory/hurricane134.html). The first optional engine offered for the CJ-6 was the [Perkins 192 I4](/engine/factory/perkins192.html) diesel followed by the [\"Dauntless\" Buick 225 V6](/engine/factory/dauntless225.html). When AMC purchased Jeep from Kaiser, they soon made the AMC [232](/engine/factory/amc232.html), [258](/engine/factory/amc258.html), and [304](/engine/factory/amc304.html) available in the CJ-6.

### Transmission

The [T-90](/transmission/factory/t90.html) 3 speed was the standard transmission for the CJ-6 for many years. It\'s close brother, the [T-86](/transmission/factory/t86.html) 3 speed was used with CJ-6s with the Dauntless V6. The [T-14](/transmission/factory/t14.html) replaced the T-90 and later the beefy [T-15](/transmission/factory/t15.html) was used with CJ-6 with the 304. The [T-98](/transmission/factory/t18.html) was an optional 4 speed for the CJ-6 until 1971 when the [T-18](/transmission/factory/t18.html) became the optional 4 speed.

### Transfer Case

The CJ-6 used the [Dana 18](/xfer/factory/d18.html) from \'58 until \'71. From \'72-\'75 they used the [Dana 20](/xfer/factory/d20.html).

### Front Axle

The CJ-6 was first offered with the [Dana 25](/axle/factory/d25.html) until 1965. The [Dana 27](/axle/factory/d27.html) replaced it and was used until 1971. From 1972-1975, the [Dana 30](/axle/factory/d30.html) was used in the CJ-6.

### Rear Axle

The [Dana 44](/axle/factory/d44.html) with two piece shafts was used in the CJ-6 until mid-1970. A [Dana 44](/axle/factory/d44.html) with one piece shafts replaced it after that.
