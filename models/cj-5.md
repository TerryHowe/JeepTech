### Engine

Many engine options have been offered for the CJ-5 over it\'s long production run. The original engine offered in the CJ-5 was the [\"Hurricane\" F-Head 134 I4](/engine/factory/hurricane134.html). The first optional engine offered for the CJ-5 was the [Perkins 192 I4](/engine/factory/perkins192.html) diesel followed by the [\"Dauntless\" Buick 225 V6](/engine/factory/dauntless225.html). When AMC purchased Jeep from Kaiser, they soon made the AMC [232](/engine/factory/amc232.html), [258](/engine/factory/amc258.html), and [304](/engine/factory/amc304.html) available in the CJ-5. The last three years of production, the [GM 151 I4](/engine/factory/gm151.html) was the standard engine.

### Transmission

The [T-90](/transmission/factory/t90.html) 3 speed was the standard transmission for the CJ-5 for many years. It\'s close brother, the [T-86](/transmission/factory/t86.html) 3 speed was used with CJ-5s with the Dauntless V6. The [T-14](/transmission/factory/t14.html) replaced the T-90 and later the beefy [T-15](/transmission/factory/t15.html) was used with CJ-5 with the 304. The [T-98](/transmission/factory/t18.html) was an optional 4 speed for the CJ-5 until 1971 when the [T-18](/transmission/factory/t18.html) became the optional 4 speed. In 1976, the [T-150](/transmission/factory/t150.html) became the 3 speed for the CJ-5. In 1980, the heavy duty 3 speeds and 4 speeds were no longer offered. The lighter duty [SR-4](/transmission/factory/t4.html), [T-4](/transmission/factory/t4.html), [T-176](/transmission/factory/t176.html), and [T-5](/transmission/factory/t5.html) were used. The CJ-5 never came with an automatic from the factory.

### Transfer Case

The CJ-5 used the [Dana 18](/xfer/factory/d18.html) from \'55 until \'71. In \'72 they switched to the [Dana 20](/xfer/factory/d20.html). From \'80-\'83 they used the [Dana 300](/xfer/factory/d300.html).

### Front Axle

The CJ-5 was first offered with the [Dana 25](/axle/factory/d25.html) until 1965. The [Dana 27](/axle/factory/d27.html) replaced it and was used until 1971. From 1972-1983, the [Dana 30](/axle/factory/d30.html) was used in the CJ-5.

### Rear Axle

The [Dana 44](/axle/factory/d44.html) with two piece shafts was used in the CJ-5 until mid-1970. A [Dana 44](/axle/factory/d44.html) with one piece shafts replaced it after that until 1975. After 1976 the [AMC 20](/axle/factory/amc20.html) was used.
