<h2>Description</h2>
<P>The Willys Pickup was produced from 1947 through 1965.
It was introduced in 1947 with 2WD and 4WD models.  There
were only a few styling changes made to the pickup over the
years.  In 1950 a new front grill was introduced mid year.
Another front grill change occurred in 1954.  In 1960, the
two piece windshield was replaced with a one piece windshield.</p>

The Willys Pickup was offered in various configurations over the
year including chassis only, chassis and cab, pickup, and platform

<h3>Engine</h3>
<p>
The Willys Pickup was introduced with the
<a href="/engine/godevil134.html">"Go Devil" L-Head 134 I4</a>
engine.  In 1950 <a href="/engine/hurricane134.html">
"Hurricane" F-Head 134 I4</a> replaced the L-Head engine.  In 1954 the
<a href="/engine/hurricane226.html">"Super Hurricane"
L-Head 226 I6</a> was offered.  In 1955 the F-Head became optional and
the 226 became standard.  In 1957, the F-Head was
not offered in the Willys pickup, but it became available again in 1959.
Revisions were made to the 226 in 1959 that gave it slightly lower HP,
but HP and torque peaks were at lower RPM.  In 1963, the
<a href="/engine/tornado230.html">"Tornado" 230 I6</a>
introduced in the pickup and the F-Head was dropped again.  In
1964, a low HP version of the 230 was available.  In the final year,
only the high HP version of the 230 was available.
