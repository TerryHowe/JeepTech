<h2>Description</h2>

<h3>Engine</h3>
<p>
The Jeepster/Commando was originally offered with the 
<a href="/engine/factory/hurricane134.html">"Hurricane" F-Head 134 I4</a>.
The
<a href="/engine/factory/dauntless225.html">"Dauntless" Buick 225 V6</a>
was an optional engine in the late 60s.
When AMC purchased Jeep from Kaiser, they soon made the AMC
<a href="/engine/factory/amc232.html">232</a>,

<a href="/engine/factory/amc304.html">304</a> available in the

<h3>Transmission</h3>
<p>
The <a href="/transmission/factory/t90.html">T-90</a> 3 speed was the standard
transmission for the Jeepster with the F-Head engine and it's
close brother, the <a href="/transmission/factory/t86.html">T-86</a> 3 speed
was used with the Dauntless V6.  The <a href="/transmission/factory/t14.html">T-14</a>
replaced the T-86 with the 6 cylinder engines and later the beefy
<a href="/transmission/factory/t15.html">T-15</a> was used with CJ-5 with the 304.
The <a href="/transmission/factory/th400.html">TH400</a> was the optional
