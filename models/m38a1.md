## Description

The M38A1 (MD) was built from 1952 until 1957 for the U.S. military
forces and from 1958 until 1971 for export to foreign governments.
The production information available for these vehicles suggests
a much more limited production run.
The M38A1 was so well liked, they introduced the CJ-5 in 1955 based on
it's design.
