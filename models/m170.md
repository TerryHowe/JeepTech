## Description

The M170 (MDA) is basically a stretched M38A1. Only 4155 were produced between the mid-1950s and the early 1960s. They were used as ambulances. The production information available for these vehicles suggests a much more limited production run.

## Drive Train

The M170 was available with the [\"Hurricane\" F-Head 134 I4](/engine/factory/hurricane134.html) engine, [T-90](/transmission/factory/t90.html) 3 speed transmission, [Dana 18](/xfer/factory/d18.html) transfer case, [Dana 25](/axle/factory/d25.html) front axle, and [Dana 44](/axle/factory/d44.html) rear axle.
