## Description
The M170 (MDA) is basically a stretched M38A1.
Only 4155 were produced between the mid-1950s
and the early 1960s.  They were used as ambulances.
The production information available for these vehicles
suggests a much more limited production run.
## Drive Train
The M170 was available with the
["Hurricane" F-Head 134 I4](/engine/hurricane134.html)
engine,
[T-90](/trans/t90.html) 3 speed transmission,
[Dana 18](/xfer/d18.html) transfer case,
[Dana 25](/axle/d25.html) front axle, and
[Dana 44](/axle/d44.html) rear axle.
