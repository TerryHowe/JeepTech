<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The CJ-2A was the first civilian Jeep. It was
produced from July 17th 1945 through 1949.
It looks similar to a M38, CJ-3A, or MB, but it has flush mounted
head lights and the wind shield is made with round tubing.  The
windshield is split were as the CJ-3A uses a one piece wind
shield (except for some export versions), is made with square tubing,
and is taller above the glass.  CJ-2A tubs are compatible with the M38,
CJ-3A, and MB tubs, but there are cosmetic differences.  All of them
used the "Go Devil" L head 134 I4 engine.

<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>Early versions of the CJ-2A (until 1946 serial number 38220) were
produced with a column shift T-90.  The later versions of the CJ-2A
were produced with "three on the floor" rather than "three on the
tree."  Some early CJ-2As also had the Spicer 23-2 rear end and shovel
and axe grooves on the drivers side like one would find on the MB.
Later CJ-2As had a Dana 41 rear end and no grooves on the drivers side.

<p>Serial numbers are located on the out side of the left front frame
horn, behind the bumper.  An exception to this is the first 100 or so

like the MBs.</p>

engine block on the water pump boss.</p>
